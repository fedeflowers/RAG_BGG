The names of these suits are:

1. **Parrot (Green)**
2. **Treasure Chest (Yellow)**
3. **Treasure Map (Purple)**
4. **Jolly Roger (Black)** - This is the trump suit.

### Game Rule Explanation:
The Jolly Roger cards (black) have a special status as they outrank all the other suits. When a player leads with a suit card, all other players must follow suit if they can. If they cannot follow the suit, they may play any other card, including a trump card. The highest card of the led suit wins the trick unless a trump card is played, which will always win against any non-trump card.

### Contextual Strategy/Advice:
When considering your strategy, it's important to keep track of which suits have been played and the potential strength of your hand. If you have a strong hand with high cards in a suit, you might want to lead with that suit to control the flow of the game. Conversely, if you have trump cards, you can use them strategically to win crucial tricks, especially if you suspect your opponents are leading with high cards in their suits.

### Example:
For instance, if you lead with a Parrot card and your opponents follow suit, you can gauge their strength based on the cards they play. If you notice that one player consistently plays lower cards, they may be holding back their stronger cards for a later trick or may not have any high cards in that suit. This information can help you decide when to play your trump cards for maximum effect.

By understanding the suits and their interactions, you can better predict the outcome of tricks and plan your bids accordingly.",0.99999999998,1.0,0.8811346752775523

This is a crucial aspect of gameplay, as it allows players to win tricks even with lower-numbered cards when they play a Jolly Roger card against standard suit cards (green, yellow, or purple).

### Game Rule Explanation:
When a Jolly Roger card is played, it automatically wins the trick unless another Jolly Roger card is played. If multiple Jolly Roger cards are played in the same trick, the highest numbered Jolly Roger card wins. This means that if you have a Jolly Roger card in your hand, you can use it strategically to take control of a trick, especially if you suspect your opponents are playing high-numbered cards from the standard suits.

For example, if Player A leads with a yellow 12, and Player B follows with a yellow 5, but Player C plays a black 2 (Jolly Roger), Player C wins the trick despite the 2 being the lowest number played. This is because the Jolly Roger card trumps the yellow cards.

### Contextual Strategy/Advice:
When considering your plays, always keep in mind the power of the Jolly Roger cards. If you have one, think about when to play it for maximum effect. It can be beneficial to hold onto your Jolly Roger cards until you can use them to win a critical trick or to disrupt your opponents' plans. Additionally, if you suspect that your opponents are trying to win a trick with high-numbered cards from the standard suits, playing a Jolly Roger can turn the tide in your favor.

### Example:
Imagine you are in a situation where you have a Jolly Roger card and the lead player plays a high card from a standard suit. If you play your Jolly Roger, you will win the trick regardless of the number on your Jolly Roger card. This can be particularly useful if you are trying to secure a specific number of tricks for your bid.

In summary, the Jolly Roger suit is the most powerful in **Skull King**, and understanding how to leverage it can significantly enhance your chances of winning tricks and ultimately the game.",0.99999999998,0.9166666666666666,0.8940685702777094

This means that if the leading player plays a card from one of the standard suits (Parrot, Treasure Chest, or Treasure Map), each subsequent player must play a card from that same suit if they have one in their hand. 

### Game Rule Explanation:
1. **Following Suit**: If a suit card is led, players must play a card of the same suit if they possess one. For instance, if the leading player plays a green 7 (Parrot), all players must play a green card if they have one.
   
2. **Playing Other Suits**: If a player does not have a card of the suit that was led, they are free to play any other card from their hand, including cards from the trump suit (Jolly Roger) or any other suit.

3. **Winning the Trick**: If all players play cards of the same suit, the player who played the highest numbered card of that suit wins the trick. However, if any player plays a trump card, that player wins the trick regardless of the numbers played in the other suits.

### Example:
Let’s say the leading player plays a yellow 10 (Treasure Chest). The next player has a yellow 5 and plays it. The third player has no yellow cards and plays a black 3 (Jolly Roger). The last player has a yellow 12 and plays it. In this case, the player who played the yellow 12 wins the trick because they followed suit and played the highest card of that suit. If the player who played the black 3 had played it instead, they would have won the trick since the black card trumps all other suits.

### Contextual Strategy/Advice:
When leading with a suit card, consider the cards you have in hand and the potential responses from your opponents. If you have a strong card in the suit you are leading, it may be beneficial to lead with it to maximize your chances of winning the trick. Conversely, if you suspect your opponents have higher cards in that suit, you might want to consider leading with a special card or a lower card to bait them into playing their high cards early.

Remember, keeping track of the suits played and the cards remaining in your opponents' hands can give you a strategic edge in future tricks!",0.99999999998,0.4117647058823529,0.8464280957942377

- Playing a card from a different suit (which will lose the trick unless it’s a trump card).
- Playing a trump card (the Jolly Roger), which will win the trick against any non-trump card, even if the trump card is of a lower number.

### Example:

- A **purple 5** (which will lose the trick).
- A **black 3** (which will win the trick, as it’s a trump card).

### Contextual Strategy/Advice:
When you find yourself without the led suit, consider the implications of your choice. If you have a trump card, it might be wise to play it to secure the trick, especially if you believe it could help you win a crucial round. If you play a non-trump card, be aware that you are likely conceding the trick to another player, so think about how that might affect your overall strategy for the round.

This means that if the leading card is a suit card (not a special card), all players must follow suit if they can. The player who played the highest value card of that suit wins the trick and collects the cards.

### Game Rule Explanation:
1. **Leading a Trick**: The first player to play a card in a trick sets the suit that must be followed. For example, if a player leads with a green 7, all players must play a green card if they have one.
  
2. **Winning the Trick**: If all players play cards of the same suit, the player with the highest numbered card of that suit wins the trick. For instance, if Player A plays a green 7, Player B plays a green 12, and Player C plays a green 8, Player B wins the trick because 12 is the highest number.

3. **Playing Non-Suit Cards**: If a player does not have a card of the led suit, they can play any other card, including a special card. However, if they play a card from a different suit, it will not win the trick unless all other cards played are also from that different suit.

### Example:
Let’s say the leading card is a yellow 10. If Player 1 plays a yellow 10, Player 2 plays a yellow 5, and Player 3 plays a yellow 12, Player 3 wins the trick because they played the highest card in the yellow suit. If Player 4, who does not have any yellow cards, plays a black (trump) card, they would win the trick regardless of the yellow cards played, since trump cards outrank all standard suit cards.

### Contextual Strategy/Advice:
When you are considering which card to play, think about not only the value of your card but also the potential cards your opponents might have. If you suspect that your opponents have high cards in the led suit, it might be wise to play a trump card if you have one, as it guarantees you the win for that trick. Additionally, keeping track of which cards have been played can help you gauge the likelihood of winning future tricks.

In summary, the winner of a trick where all cards are of the same suit is simply the player who played the highest numbered card of that suit. Keep this in mind as you strategize your plays!",0.99999999998,0.8260869565217391,0.9499856942828934

This means that if a numbered suit card is played first in a trick, and you have a special card (which does not have a number), you can choose to play that special card even if it does not match the suit that was led.

### Game Rule Explanation:
When a suit card is led, players are generally required to follow suit with a numbered card if they have one. However, special cards break this rule. They can be played at any time, regardless of the suit in play. This allows for strategic plays, especially if you want to disrupt the expected flow of the trick or if you believe your special card can win the trick.

### Example:
For instance, if the leading player plays a green 7, and you have a special card (like the Skull King or a Pirate card), you can play that special card instead of a green card. This can be particularly advantageous if you suspect that the leading player has a strong hand in the green suit, as your special card may allow you to take control of the trick.

### Contextual Strategy:
Using special cards effectively can turn the tide of a round. Consider the timing of when to play your special cards. If you hold a powerful special card, it might be wise to save it for a crucial moment when you can either secure a trick or disrupt an opponent's strategy. Always keep an eye on what suits are being played and how many tricks your opponents are likely to win based on their bids and the cards they have already played.

In summary, feel free to utilize your special cards whenever you see fit, as they provide flexibility and can be pivotal in your overall strategy!",0.99999999998,0.38095238095238093,0.8922582247798446

This means that if you do not have a card of the suit that was led, and you choose to play a card from a different suit (which is not a trump card), your card will not win the trick, even if it is the highest number played among the cards shown.

### Game Rule Explanation:
To clarify, when a trick begins, the first card played sets the suit that must be followed. If you have a card of that suit, you must play it. If you do not have a card of the led suit, you can play any other card. However, if you play a non-trump card from a different suit, it will lose to any card of the led suit, regardless of its number. 

For example, if the lead card is a yellow 12 and you play a purple 14 because you don't have any yellow cards, the yellow 12 will win the trick. This is because you did not follow suit and played a different non-trump card.

### Contextual Strategy/Advice:
In situations where you find yourself without the led suit, consider your options carefully. If you have a trump card (Jolly Roger), it can be advantageous to play it, as it will win the trick against any non-trump card. If you don't have a trump card either, think about the potential value of the card you are about to play. Sometimes, it might be better to play a lower card from a different suit if you believe it won't affect your overall strategy for the round.

### Example:
Imagine the lead card is a green 10. You have a green 5, a yellow 8, and a black 3 (trump). If you play the yellow 8, it will lose to the green 10. However, if you play the black 3, you will win the trick because trump cards beat all non-trump cards.

Here’s how it works:

### Game Rule Explanation:
1. **Trump Suit Advantage**: The trump cards (Jolly Roger) always outrank any standard suit cards (Parrot, Treasure Chest, and Treasure Map). This means that if a trump card is played in a trick, it will win against any numbered card from the other suits, regardless of its value. For example, if a player leads with a yellow 12 and another player plays a black 2, the black 2 will win the trick even though it is a lower number.

2. **Following Suit**: When a suit card is led, players must follow suit if they can. If they cannot follow suit, they can play any other card, including a trump card. If a trump card is played after a suit card has been led, it will take the trick unless another trump card is played that is of a higher value.

3. **Winning the Trick**: If all players play standard suit cards, the highest card of the led suit wins. However, if at least one trump card is played, the highest trump card wins the trick, regardless of the other cards played.

### Contextual Strategy/Advice:
When considering your play, if you have trump cards in your hand, you can use them strategically to secure tricks, especially if you anticipate that your opponents will play high-value suit cards. If you lead with a trump card, it can force your opponents to either play their own trump cards or lose the trick. 

Additionally, if you are in a situation where you are unsure of how many tricks you can win, holding onto trump cards can provide you with flexibility and a safety net to win crucial tricks later in the round.

### Example:
Imagine you are in a round where the first player leads with a green 10. The next player plays a green 5, and you have a black 3. If you play your black 3, you will win the trick despite the fact that the green 10 is the highest card played so far. This is because your trump card (black 3) beats all standard suit cards.

In summary, always keep in mind the power of trump cards in your hand and use them wisely to maximize your chances of winning tricks throughout the game!",0.99999999998,0.7692307692307693,0.891952344957245

Specifically, Pirate cards beat all numbered cards, regardless of their rank. This means that if a Pirate card is played in a trick, it will always win against any numbered card (1-14) from the standard suits (Parrot, Treasure Chest, Treasure Map).

### Game Rule Explanation:
- **Pirate Cards**: There are 5 Pirate cards in the game, and they are of equal rank among themselves. If multiple Pirate cards are played in the same trick, the first one played wins the trick.
- **Numbered Cards**: These are the cards numbered 1 through 14 in the three standard suits. They can only win against other numbered cards unless a Pirate card is played.

### Example:
Imagine you are in a trick where the following cards are played:
- Player A plays a green 12 (numbered card).
- Player B plays a Pirate card.

In this scenario, Player B wins the trick because the Pirate card beats the green 12. If Player C also plays a Pirate card, Player A's green 12 is still outmatched, and Player B would win unless Player C played their Pirate card first.

### Contextual Strategy/Advice:
When holding Pirate cards, consider the timing of when to play them. Since they are guaranteed to win against numbered cards, you can use them strategically to secure important tricks, especially if you anticipate that your opponents will play high-numbered cards. However, be mindful of the Skull King and Mermaids, as they can change the dynamics of the trick. 

In summary, always remember that Pirate cards are your trump cards against numbered cards, and use them wisely to maximize your chances of winning tricks!",0.99999999998,0.84,0.9236485670614308

Even though the 2 is the lowest number played, Jack wins the trick because black trumps other suits.""]","In **Skull King**, when multiple Pirate cards are played in a trick, the winner is determined by the order in which the Pirate cards were played. All Pirate cards are of equal rank, meaning they beat all numbered cards, but if more than one Pirate card is played during the same trick, the first Pirate card played wins the trick.

### Game Rule Explanation:
1. **Pirate Cards**: There are five Pirate cards in the game, and they beat all numbered cards. However, they do not outrank each other.
2. **Winning the Trick**: If multiple players play Pirate cards in a single trick, the player who played the first Pirate card in that trick is the one who wins it, regardless of the other Pirate cards played afterward.

### Example:
Imagine the following scenario:
- Player A plays a Pirate card first.
- Player B then plays another Pirate card.
- Player C plays a numbered card.

In this case, Player A wins the trick because they played the first Pirate card. Player B's Pirate card does not win because it was played after Player A's.

### Contextual Strategy/Advice:
When you have a hand that includes Pirate cards, consider the timing of when you play them. If you suspect that other players may also have Pirate cards, leading with your Pirate card can be a strategic move to secure the trick. However, if you are holding back your Pirate card to play it later, be mindful of the order of play, as it could affect your chances of winning the trick if others play their Pirates before you.

Keep in mind that if a Skull King is played in the same trick, it will beat all Pirate cards unless a Mermaid is also played, which would then win the trick. Always be aware of the potential for these interactions when planning your plays!",0.99999999998,0.7142857142857143,0.9675038459454642

This decision is pivotal because it determines how the Tigress interacts with other cards played in the trick.

### Game Rule Explanation:
- **Tigress as a Pirate**: If you declare the Tigress as a Pirate, she will beat all numbered cards and will compete with other Pirate cards. If multiple Pirate cards are played in the same trick, the first Pirate played wins the trick.
  
- **Tigress as an Escape**: If you choose to play the Tigress as an Escape, she will lose to all other cards, but she can help you avoid winning a trick, which is useful if you are trying to meet a specific bid.

### Contextual Strategy/Advice:
Consider your current hand and your bidding strategy when deciding how to play the Tigress. If you need to win the trick to secure your bid, playing her as a Pirate might be advantageous. Conversely, if you are trying to avoid winning more tricks than you bid, playing her as an Escape could help you achieve that goal.

### Example:
Imagine you are in a situation where you have already bid to win 3 tricks, but you suspect your opponents have strong cards. If you play the Tigress as an Escape, you can potentially avoid winning a trick if your opponents play higher cards. However, if you feel confident that you can win the trick and secure your position, declaring her as a Pirate could turn the tide in your favor.

In summary, the choice of how to play the Tigress is strategic and should align with your overall game plan and current hand dynamics.",0.99999999998,0.8947368421052632,0.9130797063499777

2. **Strategic Considerations**: Using the Tigress as a Pirate can be a strategic move, especially if you anticipate that your opponents will play high-numbered cards.

3. **Example**: If you lead a trick with the Tigress declared as a Pirate and your opponents play a yellow 14 and a blue 12, the Tigress will win the trick since she beats all numbered cards. If another player plays a Pirate after you, the first Pirate played will win, so timing is crucial.

- The **Skull King** is the highest-ranking card in the game, surpassing all numbered cards and Pirate cards. However, when a **Mermaid** is played in the same trick as the Skull King, the Mermaid wins the trick, regardless of the order in which the cards were played. This means that if you play a Mermaid against the Skull King, the Mermaid will always take the trick.

When considering your strategy, keep in mind that Mermaids can be a powerful counter to the Skull King. If you suspect that an opponent might play the Skull King, holding onto a Mermaid can be a strategic move to ensure you win that trick. Additionally, if you have both a Mermaid and the Skull King in your hand, think carefully about when to play each card to maximize your chances of winning tricks and fulfilling your bid.

### Example:
Imagine you are in a trick where you suspect your opponent has the Skull King. If you have a Mermaid in your hand, you can confidently play it to win the trick, even if the Skull King is played. Just remember, if both Mermaids are played in the same trick, the first one played wins, so timing can be crucial.

### Game Rule Explanation:

1. **Mermaids vs. Numbered Suits**: Mermaids beat all numbered cards from the standard suits (Parrot, Treasure Chest, and Treasure Map). This means if a Mermaid is played against any numbered card, the Mermaid will win the trick, regardless of the number on the card.

2. **Mermaids vs. Pirates**: Mermaids lose to all Pirate cards. However, there is an exception when the Skull King is involved. If a Mermaid is played in a trick where the Skull King is also played, the Mermaid will win the trick, regardless of the order in which the cards were played. This is a crucial point because it allows the Mermaid to capture the Skull King, which earns the player a significant bonus of 40 points.

3. **Capturing Bonuses**: If a Pirate captures a Mermaid, the player earns 20 points. Conversely, if the Skull King captures a Pirate, the player earns 30 points. Thus, the dynamics of playing Mermaids, Pirates, and the Skull King can lead to strategic plays that maximize point gains.

### Contextual Strategy/Advice:

When considering how to use Mermaids effectively, think about the current state of play and the cards your opponents might have. If you suspect that a Pirate is likely to be played, it may be wise to hold onto your Mermaid until you can either play it against the Skull King or when you can ensure it will win against a numbered card. 

Additionally, if you have the opportunity to play a Mermaid when you know a Pirate is in play, you can potentially disrupt your opponent's strategy while also positioning yourself to capture the Skull King for that valuable bonus.

### Example:

Imagine a scenario where you lead with a Mermaid, and your opponents play a Pirate and a numbered card.

This is because Mermaids are considered special cards, and when they are played, there is no suit to follow for that trick. 

### Game Rule Explanation:
1. **Leading with a Character**: When a Mermaid leads a trick, all players can play any card they choose, as there is no suit to follow.
2. **Winning the Trick**: If both players play a Mermaid, the first one played wins the trick. The second Mermaid played does not have any special effect in this scenario; it simply follows the normal rules of winning based on the order of play.

### Example:
Let’s say Player A plays a Mermaid first, and then Player B also plays a Mermaid. Player A's Mermaid wins the trick because it was played first. Player A will then collect the cards from the trick, which may include other cards played by the other players, and they will lead the next trick.

### Contextual Strategy/Advice:
When considering playing a Mermaid, think about the timing and the potential for capturing character cards. If you suspect your opponent might also have a Mermaid, it might be wise to play it strategically to either win the trick or set yourself up for future tricks. Additionally, remember that capturing Mermaids can earn you bonus points if you have Pirates in your hand, so weigh your options carefully!

This is a specific rule in Skull King that overrides the usual hierarchy of card strength.

### Game Rule Explanation:
1. **Card Hierarchy**: Normally, the Skull King is the strongest card, beating all Pirates and numbered cards. However, when a Mermaid is played alongside the Skull King and a Pirate, the Mermaid takes precedence.
2. **Winning the Trick**: The Mermaid wins the trick regardless of the order in which the cards were played. This means that even if the Skull King is played first, the Mermaid will still win the trick.

### Example:
Imagine the following scenario:
- Player A plays a Pirate.
- Player B plays the Skull King.
- Player C plays a Mermaid.

In this case, Player C wins the trick with the Mermaid, despite the presence of the Skull King and the Pirate. Player C would then score points for winning the trick and could potentially earn bonuses if the Mermaid captures the Skull King.

### Contextual Strategy/Advice:
When playing Skull King, it's essential to consider the potential for Mermaids to disrupt your plans, especially if you are relying on the strength of the Skull King or a Pirate to win a trick. If you have a Mermaid in hand, you can use it strategically to counter opponents' strong cards. Conversely, if you are playing a Pirate or the Skull King, be cautious about the possibility of a Mermaid being played against you, as it can turn the tide of the trick unexpectedly.

Here’s how it works:

### Bonus Points Breakdown:
1. **Mermaids**: If a Pirate card captures a Mermaid, the player earns **20 points** for each Mermaid taken.
2. **Skull King**: If the Skull King card captures a Pirate, the player earns **30 points** for each Pirate taken.
3. **Taking the Skull King with a Mermaid**: If a player uses a Mermaid to capture the Skull King, they earn a hefty **40 points**.

### Important Mechanics:
- The order in which players play their cards does not affect the ability to earn these bonus points. What matters is the card that wins the trick.
- Players must keep in mind that the main goal is to win tricks based on their bids, but seizing opportunities to capture these character cards can significantly boost their scores.

### Example Scenario:
Imagine during a round, a player leads with a high-value yellow card. Another player plays a Pirate, hoping to win the trick. If a third player plays the Skull King, they are aiming to capture that Pirate for the bonus points. However, if a fourth player plays a Mermaid and wins the trick, they would earn points for the yellow card and, if applicable, the bonus for capturing the Skull King with the Mermaid.

### Strategic Advice:
As you play, consider how your bids align with the potential to capture these character cards. If you notice that opponents are playing Pirates, it might be a good opportunity to play a Mermaid strategically to maximize your points. Always keep an eye on the cards that have been played to gauge the likelihood of winning tricks and capturing bonuses.

1. **Direct Hit**: If a player wins the exact number of tricks they bid, they earn all of the potential bonus points for that round. For example, if 4 cards are dealt (40 potential points) and a player bids 2 and takes exactly 2 tricks, they would score the full 40 points.

2. **Glancing Blow**: If a player is off by 1 trick from their bid, they earn half of the potential bonus points. So, if that same player bid 2 but took 3 tricks instead, they would score half of the potential points, which would be 20 points in this case.

3. **Complete Miss**: If a player is off by 2 or more tricks, they earn none of the potential bonus points. For instance, if they bid 2 but took 0 tricks, they would score 0 points for that round.

### Example Scenario:
Let’s say in a round where 5 cards are dealt (50 potential points):
- Player A bids 2 and takes 2 tricks (Direct Hit) → Scores 50 points.
- Player B bids 2 but takes 3 tricks (Glancing Blow) → Scores 25 points.
- Player C bids 2 but takes 0 tricks (Complete Miss) → Scores 0 points.

### Strategic Advice:
When considering your bid, think about the number of tricks you realistically believe you can take based on your hand and the current game dynamics. Bidding too high can lead to significant point losses, while bidding too low may not capitalize on your hand's potential. Always weigh the risk of bidding zero, as it can lead to substantial penalties if you take any tricks.

### Game Rule Explanation:

1. **Grapeshot (open hand)**: This option follows the standard Rascal scoring. If you choose Grapeshot, your scoring will be based on how accurately you bid:
   - **Correct Bid**: You earn 10 points for each card dealt that round.
   - **Off by 1**: You earn half of the potential points (5 points for each card dealt).
   - **Off by 2 or more**: You earn no points.

2. **Cannonball (closed fist)**: This option is riskier. If you choose Cannonball, your scoring is as follows:

   - **Off by 1**: You earn 0 points, regardless of how many cards were dealt.
   - **Off by 2 or more**: You also earn 0 points.

### Example:
Assuming 6 cards are dealt and you bid 3:
- If you chose **Grapeshot**:
  - **Correct Bid (3 tricks)**: Score 60 points (6 cards x 10 points).
  - **Off by 1 (2 or 4 tricks)**: Score 30 points (6 cards x 5 points).
  
- If you chose **Cannonball**:
  - **Correct Bid (3 tricks)**: Score 90 points (6 cards x 15 points).
  - **Off by 1 (2 or 4 tricks)**: Score 0 points.

### Contextual Strategy/Advice:
When deciding between Grapeshot and Cannonball, consider your confidence in your bid accuracy. If you feel certain about your bid, Cannonball can yield a higher reward. However, if you're unsure, Grapeshot provides a safety net, allowing you to still earn points even if you're slightly off. 

Think about the current game dynamics and how your opponents are bidding. If they seem to be taking risks, it might be wise to play conservatively with Grapeshot to secure points while they gamble.

1. **Correct Bid**: If your bid is correct, you will score **10 points for each card dealt** in that round. For instance, if 6 cards were dealt and you bid 3, your score would be calculated as:
   - **Score = Number of Cards Dealt x 10**
   - **Score = 6 x 10 = 60 points** for the round.

2. **Off by 1**: If you are off by 1 from your bid, you will score **half of the potential points**. Using the same example where 6 cards were dealt:
   - If you bid 3 but actually won 2 or 4 tricks, your score would be:
   - **Score = (Number of Cards Dealt x 5)**
   - **Score = 6 x 5 = 30 points** for the round.

3. **Complete Miss**: If you miss your bid by 2 or more, you score **none** of the potential points.

### Example Scenario:
- **You bid 3** and **6 cards are dealt**.
- If you win exactly 3 tricks (correct bid), you score **60 points**.
- If you win 2 or 4 tricks (off by 1), you score **30 points**.
- If you win 0 or 5 tricks (off by 2 or more), you score **0 points**.

### Strategic Insight:
Choosing **Grapeshot** can be a safer option if you feel confident in your ability to predict the number of tricks you can win accurately. It allows for a more consistent scoring method, especially if you are aiming for a steady accumulation of points rather than high-risk, high-reward scenarios. 

In contrast, if you choose **Cannonball (closed fist)**, you would need to be precise with your bid to earn the higher potential points (15 points per card dealt), but you risk scoring nothing if you are off by even 1 trick.

This is a stark contrast to the **Grapeshot (open hand)** option, where being off by 1 would still yield some points based on a reduced scoring system.

### Game Rule Explanation:
To clarify, here’s how the scoring works with the Cannonball option:
- If you bid correctly (i.e., you win the exact number of tricks you bid), you score **15 points for each card dealt**. For example, if 6 cards were dealt and you bid 3, you would score **90 points** (6 cards x 15 points).
- If you are off by 1 trick, regardless of whether you bid too high or too low, you score **0 points**. This means that if you bid 3 and won 4 tricks, or if you bid 3 and only won 2 tricks, you would not earn any points for that round.

### Contextual Strategy/Advice:
When considering whether to choose Cannonball, weigh the potential rewards against the risk of scoring nothing if you misjudge your bid. If you feel confident in your hand and the tricks you can win, Cannonball can yield high rewards. However, if you suspect that your hand may not allow you to win the exact number of tricks you bid, it might be safer to opt for Grapeshot, where you can still earn points even if you're slightly off.

### Example:
Imagine you are in a round where 5 cards are dealt, and you bid 2 tricks. If you choose Cannonball and end up winning only 1 trick, you would score **0 points**. Conversely, if you had chosen Grapeshot, you would have scored points based on how close you were to your bid. This highlights the importance of assessing your hand and the likelihood of winning the exact number of tricks before making your choice.

In summary, if you choose Cannonball and are off by 1, brace yourself for a round with no points earned, which can be a tough blow in a competitive game!",0.99999999998,0.8333333333333334,0.9144779090404626

### Contextual Strategy/Advice:

If you feel uncertain about your bid, you might want to consider the Grapeshot option instead, which offers a more forgiving scoring system.

### Example:
Let’s say you are in a round where 5 cards are dealt, and you confidently bid 3 tricks. If you choose Cannonball and win exactly 3 tricks, you would score **75 points** (5 cards x 15 points). However, if you misjudged and only won 2 tricks, you would score **0 points**.

### Game Rule Explanation:
Under the Grapeshot scoring rules, when you make a correct bid, you score points based on the number of cards dealt in that round. Specifically, you earn **10 points for each card dealt** if your bid is exactly correct. 

So, if you bid 3 and 6 cards are dealt:
- **Correct Bid**: You correctly predicted that you would win 3 tricks.
- **Points Calculation**: Since 6 cards were dealt, the total potential points for the round is calculated as follows:
  - Points for a correct bid = 6 cards x 10 points = **60 points**.

### Example:
To illustrate:
- You bid 3 tricks.
- 6 cards are dealt.
- You win exactly 3 tricks.

Since your bid was correct, you score **60 points** for that round.

### Summary:
So, to answer your question directly: if you bid 3 tricks and correctly win 3 tricks in a round where 6 cards are dealt, and you chose Grapeshot, your total score for that round would be **60 points**.

### Game Rule Explanation:
1. **Cannonball Scoring**: If you choose Cannonball (closed fist), you earn **15 points for each card dealt** if your bid is correct. However, if you are off by even 1 trick, you earn **0 points** for that round. This means that accuracy is crucial when opting for Cannonball.

2. **Correct Bid**: A correct bid means you predicted the exact number of tricks you would win. For example, if 6 cards were dealt and you bid 3, you would need to win exactly 3 tricks to score points.

3. **Off by 1**: If you bid correctly (let's say you bid 3 and won 3 tricks), but then you are off by 1 in your choice of Cannonball, you would score **0 points** for that round, regardless of the fact that your bid was correct.

### Example:
Assuming you bid 3 tricks and 6 cards were dealt:
- If you win exactly 3 tricks, you would normally score 90 points (6 cards x 15 points) if you had chosen Cannonball and were correct.
- However, if you were off by 1 (for instance, if you bid 3 but actually won 2 or 4 tricks), you would score **0 points** for that round.

1. **Study Your Hand**: After the cards are dealt, take a moment to analyze the cards you have. Pay attention to the values of your cards and their suits. Remember, the higher the card's value, the more likely it is to win a trick. 

2. **Consider the Trump Suit**: The black-bordered cards (Jolly Roger) are the trump suit and will beat any numbered card from the other suits. If you have trump cards, they can significantly influence your bidding strategy.

3. **Evaluate the Competition**: Think about the potential bids of your opponents. If you believe they might also have strong hands, you may want to adjust your bid accordingly.

4. **Make Your Bid**: Once you feel confident about your assessment, decide on the exact number of tricks you think you can win. Remember, you can bid anywhere from 0 to 10 tricks. If you bid more than 5, you will need to announce your bid verbally instead of using fingers.

5. **Record Your Bid**: Use your bid reminder cards to indicate your bid to the other players. Place one card over the other to show your bid, or stack them face down if you are bidding 10.

### Example:
If you have a strong hand with several high-value cards and a couple of trump cards, you might feel confident bidding 4 tricks. However, if your hand is weaker or you suspect your opponents have strong cards, you might choose to bid lower.

### Strategic Advice:
- **Be Realistic**: It’s crucial to be realistic about your hand's potential. Overbidding can lead to significant point losses if you fail to meet your bid.
- **Adapt to the Round**: As the game progresses through rounds, adjust your bidding strategy based on the cards dealt and the outcomes of previous rounds. 

By carefully analyzing your hand and considering the dynamics of the game, you can make an informed prediction about the number of tricks you will win in that round. Good luck, and may your bids be ever in your favor!",0.99999999998,0.85,0.917320554851806

2. **Extend Fingers or Fist**: On the third pound, each player will extend the number of fingers corresponding to their bid. For example, if you predict you will win 3 tricks, you would show three fingers. If you are bidding zero tricks, you will show a closed fist instead.

3. **Using Bid Reminder Cards**: To further clarify your bid, you will use your two bid reminder cards. Place one card over the other to indicate your bid. If you are feeling bold and wish to bid 10 tricks, you can stack both cards face down to signify this high bid.

4. **Recording Bids**: It’s important to have someone record each player’s bid on the scorepad to keep track of everyone's predictions for the round.

5. **Bidding More Than 5**: If you decide to bid more than 5 tricks, instead of showing fingers, simply announce the number out loud after the third pound.

- Pound your fist on the table three times while saying ""Yo-ho-ho!""
- On the third pound, extend four fingers.
- Use your bid reminder cards to show your bid of 4, ensuring everyone knows your prediction.

### Game Rule Explanation:
1. **Bidding Zero**: When you bid zero, you are predicting that you will win **no tricks** during that round. If you successfully take zero tricks, your score for that round will be **10 points multiplied by the number of cards dealt**. For example, if you bid zero in a round where 5 cards are dealt, and you take no tricks, you score **50 points** (10 x 5).

2. **Consequences of Taking Tricks**: If you bid zero but end up taking **one or more tricks**, you will incur a penalty. Specifically, you will lose **10 points for each card dealt that round**. So, if you bid zero in a round with 7 cards and take 2 tricks, you would score **-70 points** (10 x 7).

### Contextual Strategy/Advice:
- **Assess Your Hand**: Before bidding zero, carefully evaluate your hand. If you have high-value cards or a strong combination that could win tricks, it might be wiser to bid a number that reflects your true potential.
  
- **Reading Opponents**: Pay attention to how your opponents are bidding. If they seem to be confident and are bidding higher, it might indicate they have strong hands, which could make it more challenging for you to take zero tricks.

- **Timing**: Consider the round number and the number of cards dealt. The later rounds typically have more cards, increasing the potential score for a successful zero bid. However, the risk also escalates if you misjudge your hand.

### Example:
Imagine you are in round 6, and 6 cards are dealt. You decide to bid zero, believing you can avoid winning any tricks. If you manage to take no tricks, you score **60 points** (10 x 6). However, if you accidentally win 1 trick, you would lose **60 points** (10 x 6), resulting in a net score of **-60 points** for that round. 

In summary, bidding zero can be a bold move that pays off handsomely if executed correctly, but it requires careful consideration of your hand and the dynamics of the game.",0.99999999998,0.8571428571428571,0.8648387176089857

     - If you are bidding **6 to 10 tricks**, simply say the number out loud instead of using your fingers or cards. You can still use the cards to indicate your bid visually if you prefer, but it’s not necessary.

4. **Recording Bids**: After all players have indicated their bids, have someone record each player’s bid on the scorepad. This is crucial for tracking who will score points based on their predictions.

4. **Record Your Bid**: Make sure that a player records your bid of 10 on the scorepad, as this will be important for scoring at the end of the round.

### Strategic Considerations:
Bidding 10 is a bold move! It indicates confidence in your hand and your ability to win every trick. However, consider the following:

- **Card Strength**: Ensure that your hand has a strong combination of high-value cards. If you have many low cards or cards that are unlikely to win tricks, this bid could backfire.

- **Opponent's Bids**: Pay attention to what your opponents are bidding. If they are also bidding high, it may indicate they have strong hands, which could make it more challenging for you to win all tricks.

- **Risk vs. Reward**: Winning all tricks will yield a significant score, but if you fail to meet your bid, the penalties can be steep. Make sure you are comfortable with the risk involved.

This player will track the bids and results for all players throughout the round. 

### Game Rule Explanation:
1. **Bidding Phase**: After the cards are dealt, each player will secretly decide how many tricks they believe they can win during that round and write this number down on the scorepad in the ""Bid"" section.
2. **Recording Bids**: The scorekeeper will then write down each player's bid in the ""Bid and Result"" section of the scoresheet. This is crucial for keeping track of how well each player performed against their predictions.
3. **Post-Round Scoring**: After all tricks have been played, the scorekeeper will also record the actual number of tricks won by each player in the same section, allowing for the calculation of points based on the accuracy of their bids.

### Contextual Strategy/Advice:
As the scorekeeper, it’s important to ensure that all bids are recorded accurately and promptly after each player reveals their bid. This helps maintain the flow of the game and ensures that players can focus on their strategies without worrying about tracking their scores. Additionally, being attentive during the trick-taking phase will help you verify the results accurately when it comes time to tally points.

### Example:

30,What is the procedure for bidding if a player bids more than 5?,"['## Bidding  \nAfter the cards are dealt and you\'ve studied your hand, you\'ll decide the exact number of tricks you predict you will win in that round. Remember, the higher a card\'s value, the more likely you are to win a trick. Once you\'re all ready, you\'ll pound your fists on the table in unison three times while calling out ""Yo-ho-ho!"" On the third pound, you\'ll each extend the number of fingers equal to your bid or a closed fist if bidding zero. (Your fist on table indicates readiness) Using your 2 bid reminder cards, place one over the other to indictate your bid (see diagram below). If you\'re brave enough to bid 10, simply stack both face down. Have a player record each player\'s bid on the scorepad.

In clockwise order, each other player plays a card following the rules outlined in the previous sections.  \n13 The person who played the highest-ranking card wins the trick, gathers the cards into a stack, and places the stack in front of them. Then, they play a card to lead the next trick. Play continues until all the tricks in that round have been played. Tally each player's score, including any bonus points earned, on the scorepad. The player to the dealer's left becomes the new dealer. This player shuffles all cards, including the ones played in the previous round, and then deals them, increasing the number of cards dealt by 1 from the previous round. After the tenth round is completed, final scores are tallied, the player with the highest score is declared the victor and is appointed as the pirate captain of the seven seas!

Instead of extending fingers to indicate the number of tricks they are bidding, the player must simply **say the number out loud** during the third pound of the table. This is to ensure clarity and avoid confusion, as extending fingers for higher bids could be difficult to interpret.

Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of the procedure for bidding more than 5:

1. **Preparation**: After the cards are dealt and players have studied their hands, they decide how many tricks they predict they will win.
  
2. **The Call**: Once everyone is ready, all players pound their fists on the table three times while calling out ""Yo-ho-ho!"" This signals that the bidding is about to commence.

3. **Bidding**: On the third pound:
   - If a player bids **5 or fewer**, they extend the corresponding number of fingers.
   - If a player bids **more than 5**, they **say the number out loud** instead of using fingers. For example, if a player bids 7, they would clearly state ""seven"" for everyone to hear.

4. **Recording Bids**: After all bids are declared, a player should record each player's bid on the scorepad for reference during the round.

5. **Using Bid Reminder Cards**: Players can still use their bid reminder cards to indicate their bids visually, but remember that for bids over 5, the verbal declaration is essential.

### Example:
If Player A decides to bid 8 tricks, they would say ""eight"" aloud during the third pound. This ensures that all players are aware of their bid, and it can be recorded accurately on the scorepad.

### Strategic Insight:
When bidding more than 5, consider the strength of your hand and the potential for winning tricks. Bidding high can be risky if your cards aren't strong enough to secure the number of tricks you predict. Always weigh the likelihood of winning against the penalty for missing your bid, which is a loss of 10 points for each trick you are off.

By following this procedure, you ensure that the bidding phase runs smoothly and that everyone is on the same page regarding their predictions for the round. Happy sailing, and may your bids be ever in your favor!",0.99999999998,0.6818181818181818,0.8967745587622141

There are 5 Escape cards in the game, and they are unique in that they lose to all other cards, including numbered cards, Pirates, the Skull King, and Mermaids. This makes them particularly useful for players who want to ensure they do not exceed their bid for the round.

### Game Rule Explanation:
When you play an Escape card, you are effectively saying, ""I do not want to win this trick."" This can be crucial in managing your bids, especially if you find yourself in a situation where you might win more tricks than you intended. For example, if you bid that you will win 2 tricks but find yourself in a position where you might win a third, playing an Escape card can help you avoid that unwanted win.

Additionally, if all players in a trick play an Escape card, a Tigress (if declared as an Escape), or a Loot card, the first card played wins the trick. This means timing and order of play can be important when using Escape cards.

### Contextual Strategy/Advice:
Using Escape cards strategically can help you maintain control over your bids. If you anticipate that you might win a trick that you don’t want to win, consider holding onto your Escape cards until the right moment. This can also be a way to mislead your opponents about your intentions, as they may think you are trying to win when you are actually planning to play an Escape card.

### Example:
Imagine you have bid to win 3 tricks in a round. As the tricks progress, you notice that you have already won 2 tricks and are at risk of winning a third. If you have an Escape card in hand, you can play it in the next trick to ensure you do not exceed your bid, thus preserving your score for that round.

In summary, Escape cards are a tactical tool in **Skull King** that can help you manage your bids effectively and avoid unwanted wins, allowing you to play more strategically against your opponents.",0.99999999998,1.0,0.9866275292765724

Here’s how they work:

### Game Rule Explanation

1. **Escape Cards**: The 5 escape cards are designed to allow a player to ""not win"" a trick. They have no value against any other card, meaning they will always lose to any numbered card or special card played in the same trick.

2. **Winning a Trick**: When a trick is played, each player lays down one card. The highest card wins the trick unless a special rule applies. If an escape card is played, it does not contribute to winning the trick. 

3. **Interaction with Other Cards**: If you play an escape card, you are effectively saying, ""I do not want to win this trick."" However, if all players in the trick play escape cards, the first escape card played wins the trick. This is a unique situation that can lead to strategic plays, especially if you anticipate others will also play escape cards.

4. **Special Cards**: If a special card (like the Tigress or a loot card) is played alongside an escape card, the special card will win unless all players play escape cards. In that case, the first escape card played wins.

### Contextual Strategy/Advice

Using escape cards effectively can be a strategic advantage. They are particularly useful when you want to ensure you do not exceed your bid for tricks. Consider the following strategies:

- **Timing**: Play your escape cards when you believe you have already won enough tricks or when you want to avoid winning a trick that could disrupt your planned bid.

- **Reading Opponents**: Pay attention to how your opponents are playing. If you suspect they might also want to avoid winning a trick, leading with an escape card could force them into a tricky situation.

- **Bluffing**: Sometimes, leading with a strong card can bait opponents into playing their escape cards, allowing you to win the trick with a lower card later.

### Example

Imagine you are in a situation where you have already won two tricks, and you need to avoid winning more to meet your bid. If you play an escape card and notice that your opponents are also cautious, they might follow suit, leading to a scenario where the first escape card played wins the trick. This can help you maintain control over your bid while still participating in the round.

Here’s how they work and how you can effectively use them:

### Game Rule Explanation

Escape cards are unique in that they have a value of zero and lose to all other cards. This means that when you play an escape card, you are essentially saying, ""I do not want to win this trick."" This can be particularly useful if you find yourself in a situation where winning a trick would exceed the number of tricks you bid.

For example, if you bid to win 3 tricks but find yourself in a position where you might win a fourth, playing an escape card allows you to avoid that unwanted win. This helps you stay within your bid and ensures you score points for the tricks you successfully predicted.

### Contextual Strategy/Advice

When considering your strategy, think about the timing of your escape card plays. If you anticipate that a trick is likely to be won by a higher card, playing an escape card can help you avoid that trick. However, be mindful of the other players' bids and the cards they might have. If you suspect that others are also trying to avoid winning tricks, you might want to hold onto your escape cards until you can better gauge the flow of the game.

Additionally, remember that if multiple players play escape cards in the same trick, the first card played wins. This means that if you are confident that you will not win the trick, you might want to play your escape card early to ensure you avoid winning.

### Example

Imagine you have a hand where you’ve bid to win 2 tricks. As the rounds progress, you notice that you have already won 2 tricks, but you are concerned that the next round might lead you to win a third. By playing an escape card in that round, you effectively communicate your intention to not win, thus helping you stick to your bid and avoid penalties for overbidding.

In summary, use escape cards strategically to manage your trick wins and stay aligned with your bids. They are a powerful tool in your hand that can help you navigate tricky situations and secure your points effectively.",0.99999999998,0.56,0.8770604426502088

Only the Mermaid capturing the Skull King bonus is earned.""]","When a **Mermaid**, **Pirate**, **Skull King**, **Tigress** (when played as a Pirate), **Kraken**, or **White Whale** leads a trick in **Skull King**, the rules change significantly regarding how players can respond. Here’s how it works:

### Game Rule Explanation:
1. **No Suit to Follow**: When any of these character cards lead a trick, there is no suit that other players must follow. This means that players can play any card from their hand, regardless of its suit or number.

2. **Character Effects**:
   - **Kraken**: If the Kraken is played, the trick is completely destroyed. No one wins the trick, and all cards played are set aside. The next trick is led by the player who would have won the trick if the Kraken had not been played.
   - **White Whale**: When the White Whale is played, it affects both special and numbered cards. Special cards are destroyed and cannot win. Numbered cards lose their color and are evaluated purely by their number, meaning the highest numbered card wins the trick. If only special cards are played, the trick is discarded, similar to the Kraken, and the player who played the White Whale leads the next trick.

3. **Character Bonuses**: Capturing character cards can earn you bonus points:
   - **20 points** for each Mermaid taken by a Pirate.
   - **30 points** for each Pirate taken by the Skull King.
   - **40 points** for taking the Skull King with a Mermaid.

### Example:
Let’s say you lead with a **Skull King**. The other players can play any card they want. If one player plays a **Kraken**, the trick is destroyed, and no one wins. If another player plays a **White Whale** after the Kraken, the White Whale's effect will not apply since the trick has already been destroyed.

### Contextual Strategy/Advice:
When leading with one of these character cards, consider the potential responses from your opponents. If you lead with a **Kraken**, you can disrupt the flow of the game, but be aware that it may also prevent you from winning any points for that trick. If you lead with a **White Whale**, think about what cards your opponents might have that could be affected by its ability to change the winning criteria. 

In general, leading with these powerful cards can be a strategic move to control the game, but it also opens up opportunities for your opponents to capitalize on the chaos. Always keep an eye on the cards that have been played and the potential for bonuses that can be earned through character captures.",0.99999999998,1.0,0.9857133779106629

This is a key aspect of the game mechanics when special cards are played. 

### Game Rule Explanation:
When a special character card such as a Mermaid, Pirate, Skull King, Tigress as a Pirate, Kraken, or White Whale is led, the rules change significantly. Specifically, there is no suit to follow for that trick. This means that each player can play any card from their hand, regardless of the suit that was led. 

For example, if a player leads with a Skull King, the other players can choose to play any card they wish, whether it matches the suit of the Skull King or not. This can lead to some interesting strategies, as players may choose to play high cards from other suits or even their own special cards to try and win the trick.

### Contextual Strategy/Advice:
When leading with a character card, consider the potential responses from your opponents. Since they can play any card, you might want to lead with a strong character card if you believe your opponents have weaker cards. Alternatively, if you suspect they have high cards in other suits, you might want to play a card that can disrupt their strategy or force them to waste their strong cards.

### Example:
Imagine you lead with a Kraken. Your opponents can now play any card they choose. If one opponent plays a high card from a different suit, you might want to gauge whether you can win the trick with a lower card from your hand or if you should hold onto your stronger cards for later tricks.

### Game Rule Explanation:
1. **Leading with a Character**: When a character card is played to lead a trick, it sets a unique scenario where the normal suit-following rules do not apply. Each player can choose any card to play, which can lead to more strategic plays and unexpected outcomes.
  
2. **Winning the Trick**: The player who plays the highest-ranking card (regardless of suit) wins the trick. If a player plays a special card, such as a Skull King or a Tigress, they may have additional effects or benefits that could influence the outcome of the trick.

### Contextual Strategy/Advice:
- **Flexibility in Card Play**: Since you can play any card when a character leads, consider your options carefully. If you have a high-value card that could win the trick, it might be wise to play it. However, if you suspect that your opponents may have even higher cards, you might want to play a lower card to save your stronger cards for later tricks.

- **Observing Opponents**: Pay attention to the cards your opponents play. If they seem to be holding back their high cards, it might indicate they are waiting for a more advantageous moment to play them. Use this information to gauge when to play your strongest cards.

### Example:
Imagine a scenario where a Skull King is led. You have a mix of cards, including a high-value suit card and a special card. Since you can play either, you might choose to play your special card if you believe it will secure the trick, especially if it has a strong effect. Alternatively, if you think your opponents will play even stronger cards, you might opt to play a lower card to conserve your resources for future tricks.

In summary, when a character leads a trick, embrace the freedom of choice and strategize based on your hand and your opponents' tendencies. This flexibility can be a powerful tool in securing tricks and ultimately winning the game!",0.99999999998,1.0,0.8849193726129031

This means that if, for example, 5 cards are dealt in a round, the total potential score for that round would be **50 points** (10 points x 5 cards).

### Scoring Breakdown:
- **Direct Hit**: If you bid the exact number of tricks you win, you earn all of the potential round points. Using the previous example, if you bid 3 and win exactly 3 tricks in a round with 5 cards dealt, you would score the full 50 points.
  
- **Glancing Blow**: If you are off by 1 trick (either over or under), you earn half of the potential round points. So, if you bid 3 but only win 2 tricks, you would score 25 points (half of 50).

- **Complete Miss**: If you are off by 2 or more tricks, you earn none of the potential points. For instance, if you bid 3 but win 0 tricks, you would score 0 points.

### Bidding Zero:
If you decide to bid zero, the stakes change slightly. If you correctly predict that you will win zero tricks, your score will be **10 points times the number of cards dealt**. For example, if you bid zero in a round with 7 cards dealt and take no tricks, you would score 70 points (10 x 7). However, if you bid zero and win even one trick, you would lose **10 points for each card dealt**, which can lead to significant negative scores.

### Strategic Considerations:
When deciding how many tricks to bid, consider the number of cards dealt and your hand's strength. If you have a strong hand, you might want to bid higher to maximize your potential points. Conversely, if your hand is weak, a zero bid could be a strategic move, but be cautious of the risks involved.

### Example:
In a round where 6 cards are dealt, if you bid 2 and win 2 tricks, you would score 60 points (10 points x 6 cards). If you bid 2 but only win 1 trick, you would score 30 points (half of 60). If you bid 2 and win 0 tricks, you would score 0 points.

Therefore, with 5 cards, your potential score would be:

This means that regardless of whether you bid 0, 1, 3, or 5 tricks, your potential score remains 50 points. 

Now, how you actually score those points depends on your accuracy in predicting the number of tricks you will win:

- **Direct Hit**: If you hit your bid exactly, you earn all 50 points.
- **Glancing Blow**: If you are off by 1 trick, you earn half of the potential points, which would be 25 points.
- **Complete Miss**: If you are off by 2 or more tricks, you earn none of the potential points, resulting in 0 points.

### Strategy Tip:
When considering your bid, think about the strength of your hand and the likelihood of winning tricks based on the cards you hold. If you feel confident in your hand, a higher bid might be appropriate. However, if you're uncertain, a more conservative bid could protect you from a complete miss.

### Example:
If you bid 3 tricks and successfully win exactly 3 tricks, you would score the full 50 points. If you bid 3 but only win 2 tricks, you would score 25 points. Conversely, if you bid 3 and win 5 tricks, you would score 0 points, as you missed your bid by more than 2.

This means that your bid matches the actual number of tricks you win exactly. When you achieve a Direct Hit, you earn all of the potential points available for that round based on the number of cards dealt.

### Game Rule Explanation:
To clarify, each round, a certain number of cards are dealt, which corresponds to the round number (for example, in Round 3, 3 cards are dealt). The potential points for that round are calculated as 10 points for each card dealt. So, if 3 cards are dealt, the potential score for that round is 30 points.

If you bid 2 and successfully win exactly 2 tricks, you achieve a Direct Hit and score the full 30 points. Conversely, if you bid 2 but only win 1 trick, you would not achieve a Direct Hit, and your score would be affected accordingly.

### Example:
Let’s say in Round 4, 4 cards are dealt, giving a potential score of 40 points. If you bid 3 and win exactly 3 tricks, you have a Direct Hit and earn the full 40 points. If you had bid 3 but only won 2 tricks, you would be off by 1, resulting in a Glancing Blow, where you would earn half of the potential points, which would be 20 points.

### Contextual Strategy/Advice:
When making your bid, consider not only your hand but also the tendencies of your opponents. If you believe they might overbid or underbid based on their cards, you can adjust your strategy accordingly. Aiming for a Direct Hit can be rewarding, but it’s essential to balance risk and reward based on the cards you hold and the dynamics of the game.

In summary, a Direct Hit is a critical aspect of scoring in *Skull King*, rewarding precise predictions and strategic play. Keep an eye on your opponents' bids and adjust your strategy to maximize your chances of hitting your target!",0.99999999998,1.0,0.8928060688111991

The potential points are calculated based on the number of cards dealt in that round, with each card being worth 10 points.

### Game Rule Explanation:
To clarify, here’s how scoring works in relation to your bids:
- **Direct Hit**: If you hit your bid exactly, you earn all potential points for the round.
- **Glancing Blow**: If you are off by 1 from your bid, you earn half of the potential points.
- **Complete Miss**: If you are off by 2 or more, you earn no points.

For example, if 4 cards are dealt in a round, the total potential points for that round would be 40 points (4 cards x 10 points each). If you bid 2 and end up being off by 1 (meaning you took either 1 or 3 tricks), you would score half of the potential points, which would be 20 points.

### Contextual Strategy/Advice:
When making your bids, consider the likelihood of achieving a ""Glancing Blow."" If you feel uncertain about hitting your exact bid, it might be wise to aim for a bid that allows for a glancing blow, especially if you believe you can manage the tricks closely. This way, even if you miss your exact target, you still secure some points rather than risking a complete miss.

### Example:
Let’s say you bid 3 in a round where 5 cards are dealt (50 potential points). If you end up taking 2 tricks, you would be off by 1, resulting in a ""Glancing Blow."" Therefore, you would earn 25 points for that round (half of 50).

### Game Rule Explanation:
When you make a bid, you're predicting the exact number of tricks you believe you can win. If you miss your bid by 2 or more, you do not score any points for that round, regardless of how many tricks you actually won. This is a significant penalty, as it can greatly impact your overall score.

For instance, if you bid 3 tricks but end up winning 1 trick, you are off by 2. Therefore, you would score **0 points** for that round. This rule emphasizes the importance of making accurate bids, as overestimating your ability can lead to a complete loss of potential points.

### Contextual Strategy/Advice:
When considering your bid, it's crucial to evaluate your hand carefully and think about the likelihood of winning the number of tricks you plan to bid. If you're uncertain, it might be safer to bid lower or even consider a zero bid if you feel confident you won't win any tricks. Remember, the risk of a zero bid is that if you win even one trick, you will incur a penalty.

### Example:
Imagine you are in a round where you have a hand that seems strong, and you bid 4 tricks. However, if the play goes against you and you only manage to win 1 trick, you would be off by 3. This results in a **Complete Miss**, and you would score **0 points** for that round. Conversely, if you had bid 1 trick and won 1, you would score points, reinforcing the importance of strategic bidding.

### Game Rule Explanation:
In the scoring method you referenced, each round has a fixed potential score based on the number of cards dealt. For example, if 5 cards are dealt, the potential score for that round is 50 points (10 points for each card). This potential score remains the same regardless of whether a player bids 0, 1, 3, or 5 tricks. 

The way you earn points from this potential score is based on your accuracy in bidding:
- **Direct Hit**: If you bid the exact number of tricks you win, you earn all of the potential round points.
- **Glancing Blow**: If you are off by 1 trick, you earn half of the potential round points.
- **Complete Miss**: If you are off by 2 or more tricks, you earn none of the potential round points.

### Contextual Strategy/Advice:
When considering your bid, think about your confidence in predicting the number of tricks you can win. Since the potential points are fixed, your strategy should focus on accurately assessing your hand and the likely outcomes based on your opponents' tendencies. If you feel uncertain, a conservative bid might be wise, especially if you suspect others will be aggressive.

### Example:
If you are in a round where 6 cards are dealt, the potential score is 60 points. If you bid 2 tricks and win exactly 2, you would score 60 points. If you bid 2 but win 1, you would score 30 points (half of the potential score). If you bid 2 and win 4, you would lose 20 points (10 points for each trick you were off).

### Game Rule Explanation:
To clarify, here’s how it works:
- **Bidding One or More**: If you predict you will win a certain number of tricks and you hit that number exactly, you earn points based on the formula: **20 points × number of tricks taken**. 
- If you take more or fewer tricks than you bid, you will lose points instead. Specifically, you lose **10 points for each trick you were off** from your bid.

### Example:
For instance, if you bid 4 tricks and end up taking 4 tricks, you score 80 points (20 × 4). However, if you bid 4 but only take 2 tricks, you would be off by 2 tricks and lose 20 points (-10 × 2), resulting in a score of -20 for that round.

### Contextual Strategy/Advice:
When making your bid, consider the strength of your hand and the likelihood of winning the number of tricks you are bidding for. If you feel confident in your cards, aim for a higher bid to maximize your points. However, if your hand is weak, it might be wise to bid lower or even consider a zero bid, which has its own risks and rewards.

Specifically, for each trick they take beyond their bid, they will lose **10 points**. This means that capturing more tricks than you predicted can significantly impact your score negatively.

### Game Rule Explanation:
When you make a bid, you are predicting the exact number of tricks you will win during that round. If you exceed that number, the scoring works as follows:

- **Example**: Let’s say you bid 2 tricks but ended up capturing 4 tricks. You are off by 2 tricks (4 - 2 = 2), so you would lose 20 points for that round (-10 points for each trick you were off). Therefore, your score for that round would be calculated as follows:
  - Points lost: -20 points
  - Total score for the round: 0 points (since you don’t earn points for tricks captured when you are off your bid).

### Contextual Strategy/Advice:
When bidding, it’s crucial to assess your hand carefully and consider the likelihood of winning the number of tricks you bid. If you feel uncertain about your hand's strength, it might be wise to bid conservatively. Remember, bidding zero can be a strategic move if you believe you can avoid capturing tricks, as it offers a potential reward based on the number of cards dealt.

### Example:
If you bid 0 and successfully take 0 tricks, you would score points based on the number of cards dealt that round (10 points per card). However, if you bid 0 and end up taking 1 or more tricks, you would incur a penalty of -10 points for each card dealt, which can be quite steep.

In summary, always weigh the risks of overbidding against the potential rewards of accurately predicting your trick-taking ability. Good luck, and may your bids be ever in your favor!",0.99999999998,0.9333333333333333,0.9550144091988685

However, if you capture more or fewer tricks than you bid, you will lose **10 points for each trick you were off**. Importantly, you do not earn any points for tricks captured beyond your bid. 

For example, if you bid 2 tricks and end up capturing 4, you are off by 2 tricks. This means you would lose 20 points for that round (10 points for each trick you were off). The same applies if you capture fewer tricks than you bid; you would lose points accordingly.

### Contextual Strategy/Advice:
When making your bid, consider the cards in your hand and the potential plays of your opponents. If you feel confident in your ability to take a specific number of tricks, make a bid that reflects that confidence. However, if you think you might struggle, it may be wise to underbid rather than risk losing points. 

### Example:
Let’s say you bid 3 tricks but only manage to take 1. You would lose 20 points for being off by 2 tricks. Conversely, if you had bid 1 trick and managed to take 1, you would earn 20 points. This illustrates the importance of making a calculated bid based on your hand and the dynamics of the game.

Let’s break down how points are calculated in this scenario.

### Game Rule Explanation

When you make a bid of one or more tricks and then take exactly that number of tricks, you earn **20 points for each trick taken**. This means if you bid 3 tricks and win 3 tricks, your score for that round would be calculated as follows:

- **Points Earned** = Number of Tricks Won × 20
- **Example**: If you bid 3 and take 3 tricks:
  - Points Earned = 3 tricks × 20 points = **60 points**

### Contextual Strategy/Advice

When considering your bid, think about the strength of your hand and the likelihood of winning tricks based on the cards you hold. Higher-value cards increase your chances of winning tricks, so if you have a strong hand, don’t hesitate to bid confidently. However, if you’re unsure, it might be wise to bid conservatively to avoid penalties for missing your bid.

### Example

Let’s say you are playing in round 5, and you have a hand that you feel confident about. You decide to bid 4 tricks. After the round, you successfully take 4 tricks. Here’s how your scoring would look:

- **Bid**: 4 tricks
- **Tricks Won**: 4 tricks
- **Points Calculation**: 
  - Points Earned = 4 tricks × 20 points = **80 points**

This scoring method rewards you for accurately predicting your performance, so always assess your hand carefully before making your bid! If you ever find yourself off by any number of tricks, remember that you will incur a penalty of **10 points for each trick you missed**, so aim for precision in your bidding.",0.99999999998,0.5625,0.9261509523517842

To clarify, when the Kraken is played:
- All cards in that trick are discarded, and no player collects them.
- The player who would have won the trick (the one who played the highest card that was not consumed by the Kraken) is the one who leads the next trick.

For example, if Player A played a Pirate card, Player B played a Skull King, and Player C played a Kraken, the Kraken consumes all cards, and Player A would lead the next trick since they had the highest card before the Kraken was played.

### Contextual Strategy/Advice:
In scenarios where the Kraken is in play, it can be strategic to consider how you might play your cards to either avoid losing a trick or to set yourself up to lead the next one. If you suspect the Kraken might be played, think about which cards you can afford to lose and which ones you want to keep for future tricks.

### Example:
Imagine you are in a situation where you have a strong card but also a Kraken in your hand. If you lead with your strong card and someone plays the Kraken, you will not win that trick, but you will be the one to lead the next trick.

Here’s how it works:

1. **Destruction of Special Cards**: When the White Whale is played, all special cards that are in the trick are destroyed and cannot win. This means that if you play a special card (like the Skull King or a Pirate) in the same trick as the White Whale, that special card is effectively rendered useless for that round.

2. **Effect on Numbered Cards**: The White Whale also changes the dynamics for numbered cards. All numbered cards (including trump cards) lose their suit and instead are evaluated solely based on their number. The highest numbered card wins the trick, regardless of the original suit. If there is a tie in numbers, the first card played among the tied cards wins.

3. **Discarding the Trick**: If only special cards are played in the trick when the White Whale is present, then the trick is discarded entirely, similar to how it would be with the Kraken. In this case, the player who played the White Whale will lead the next trick.

### Example Scenario:
Imagine a trick where the following cards are played:
- Player A plays a Skull King (special card).
- Player B plays a Pirate (special card).
- Player C plays a numbered card, say a yellow 14.
- Player D plays the White Whale.

In this scenario:
- The Skull King and Pirate are destroyed and cannot win.
- The yellow 14 is the only numbered card left, so it wins the trick, regardless of the fact that it was played after the special cards.

### Strategic Insight:
When considering playing the White Whale, think about the special cards your opponents might have. If you suspect they have powerful special cards, playing the White Whale can neutralize their impact and allow your numbered cards to take precedence. Conversely, if you have a strong special card, be cautious about playing it if you suspect the White Whale might be in play, as it could lead to your card being discarded without any chance of winning.

By understanding how the White Whale interacts with special cards, you can make more informed decisions about when to play your cards and how to strategize your bids in the game.",0.99999999998,0.46153846153846156,0.9190597098227286

This means that no player wins the trick, and the player who played the White Whale will lead the next trick.

### Game Rule Explanation:
1. **White Whale Effect**: The White Whale has a unique ability that affects the outcome of the trick. If it is played alongside other special cards, those special cards cannot win the trick. Instead, they are treated as ""escapes,"" meaning they are effectively discarded.
   
2. **Trick Discarding**: When only special cards are played (including the White Whale), the trick is discarded, and no points are awarded. The player who played the White Whale then leads the next trick.

### Example:
Imagine a scenario where players have played the following special cards: a **Skull King**, a **Pirate**, and the **White Whale**. Since the White Whale is in play, all other special cards are discarded, and the trick is lost. The player who played the White Whale will then lead the next trick.

### Contextual Strategy/Advice:
When you have the White Whale in your hand, consider the potential for discarding a trick if you anticipate that only special cards will be played. This can be a strategic move to regain control of the game by leading the next trick. Additionally, if you suspect your opponents are holding special cards, playing the White Whale can help you avoid losing a trick while positioning yourself to lead the next round.

Here’s how it works:

### Game Rule Explanation:
1. **Effect of the White Whale**: When the White Whale is played in a trick, it affects both special cards and numbered cards. Specifically:
   - **Special Cards**: If any special cards (like the Skull King or Pirates) are played, they are destroyed and cannot win the trick. The trick is discarded, similar to when the Kraken is played.
   - **Numbered Cards**: For numbered cards, the White Whale causes them to ""turn white with fear."" This means that the highest numbered card wins the trick, regardless of the suit. 

2. **Determining the Winner**:
   - If the White Whale is played alongside numbered cards, you compare the numbers only. The highest number wins. If there is a tie (two players play the same highest number), the first one who played that number wins the trick.
   - If only special cards are played and the White Whale is in the trick, the trick is discarded, and the player who played the White Whale leads the next trick.

### Example:
Let’s say during a trick, the following cards are played:
- Player A plays a black 2 (Jolly Roger).
- Player B plays a Pirate (special card).
- Player C plays a yellow 14 (numbered card).
- Player D plays the White Whale.

In this scenario:
- The Pirate is destroyed, and thus it cannot win.
- The White Whale is now in play, which means we only consider the numbered cards. The black 2 and yellow 14 are compared.
- The yellow 14 wins the trick because it is the highest numbered card played.

### Contextual Strategy/Advice:
When you know the White Whale is in play, be strategic about your numbered cards. If you have a high numbered card, consider holding it until you can play it after the White Whale, ensuring it can win the trick. Conversely, if you suspect the White Whale might be played, you might want to play your special cards early to avoid losing them to the White Whale's effect.

Specifically, the first card played among the tied cards wins the trick. 

### Game Rule Explanation:
When the White Whale is in play, it alters the outcome of the trick significantly. It causes all special cards to be discarded and makes numbered cards lose their suit, meaning that only their numbers matter. The highest numbered card wins the trick. However, if two or more players play cards of the same highest number, the player who played their card first among those tied cards is declared the winner of the trick.

### Example:
Let’s say during a trick, the following cards are played:
- Player A plays a yellow 14.
- Player B plays a yellow 14 (tie).
- Player C plays a yellow 10.
- Player D plays the White Whale.

In this scenario, since the White Whale is played, the special cards are discarded, and the numbered cards are evaluated. The two yellow 14s are tied, but since Player A played their 14 before Player B, Player A wins the trick.

### Contextual Strategy/Advice:
When playing with the White Whale, it's crucial to be mindful of the order in which you play your cards, especially if you suspect others may play the same high-numbered cards. If you have a high card that could tie with another player, consider leading with it if you think the White Whale might come into play. This way, you can secure the win in case of a tie.

This means that instead of the standard number of cards dealt per round, you will shuffle and deal three separate hands of cards to each player at the beginning of the game. 

### Game Rule Explanation:
1. **Dealing Hands**: You will shuffle the deck and deal out three hands of cards to each player. Each hand consists of the same number of cards as you would normally deal in a round, but you will be playing with these three hands throughout the game.
2. **Bidding and Playing**: Players will bid and play following the normal rules of Skull King. However, there’s a twist with Graybeard's ghost, who will play his cards second in each trick.
3. **Graybeard's Role**: Remember, Graybeard does not bid and does not keep score. His cards are played to add an element of unpredictability to the game, as he does not follow suit and plays solely to disrupt the other players.

### Contextual Strategy/Advice:
When playing with Graybeard, consider how his unpredictable card play can affect your strategy. Since he plays second, you can gauge the strength of your hand based on what he plays. This can help you decide whether to play aggressively or conservatively in each trick.

### Example:
For instance, if you lead with a high card and Graybeard plays a lower card, you can feel confident about winning that trick. Conversely, if he plays a strong card, you may want to reconsider your approach in subsequent tricks, especially if you have a bid to fulfill.

This sets the tone for the trick, as the leading card determines the suit that must be followed by the other player unless a special character card is played.

Now, regarding Graybeard's ghost: he participates in the trick by always playing his card second, regardless of who leads. After the first player has played their card, you will flip over the top card from Graybeard's hand and add it to the trick. Importantly, Graybeard does not have to follow suit, which means he can play any card from his hand. This can add an unpredictable element to the game, as his card could potentially change the outcome of the trick.

For example, if you lead with a high-value card, and Graybeard plays a Jolly Roger (the trump suit), he could win the trick even if your card was higher in its original suit. If Graybeard wins the trick, he will lead the next one; otherwise, he will always play second in the following trick.

**Strategic Insight**: When considering your plays, keep in mind that Graybeard's unpredictable nature can be used to your advantage. If you anticipate that he might play a weaker card, you can lead with a strong card to secure the trick. Conversely, if you suspect he might play a trump card, you might want to hold back your high cards to avoid wasting them.

In summary, the first trick is led by the player to the left of the dealer, and Graybeard always plays second, adding an element of surprise to each round. Use this to your advantage by planning your plays around the potential outcomes of Graybeard's contributions!",0.99999999998,0.6363636363636364,0.9023356052151289

### Game Rule Explanation:
1. **Winning a Trick**: If Graybeard's card is the highest in the trick, he wins it. The player controlling Graybeard will then lead the next trick.
2. **Leading the Next Trick**: The player who leads the next trick can choose any card from their hand to play, and Graybeard will play his card second, as usual.
3. **No Suit Following**: Since Graybeard does not have to follow suit, he can play any card from his hand, which can lead to unexpected outcomes.

### Contextual Strategy/Advice:
When playing against Graybeard, it’s essential to consider how his card choices might disrupt your strategy. If you anticipate that Graybeard might win a trick, think about how you can adjust your play in the following trick. For example, if you know he has powerful cards left, you might want to play conservatively to avoid giving him the lead.

### Example:
Imagine you are playing a round, and you lead with a strong card, but Graybeard plays a higher card and wins the trick. Now, he leads the next trick. If you have a weaker hand, you might want to play a card that you don’t mind losing, allowing you to save your stronger cards for when you can regain control after Graybeard's unpredictable plays.

In summary, when Graybeard wins a trick, he takes the lead for the next one, which can significantly affect your strategy and the flow of the game. Always be prepared for his ghostly antics!",0.99999999998,0.52,0.957583261183908

There are three standard suits; Parrot (green), Treasure  \n![7_image_0.png](7_image_0.png) Chest (yellow), Treasure Map (purple), and the trump suit: Jolly Roger (Black). Jolly Roger cards outrank (trump) the other three suits.  \n8 If a suit card is played first in a trick (lead), all players must 'follow suit' and play that same suit (if they are going to play a numbered card).

This is a key aspect of his role in the game. Since Graybeard is not bound by the rules of following suit, he can play any card from his hand regardless of what suit was led.

### Game Rule Explanation:
When it's Graybeard's turn to play, you simply flip over the top card of his hand and add it to the trick. He doesn't have to adhere to the suit that was led, which means he can play any card, including trump cards (the Jolly Roger) or cards from any of the standard suits (Parrot, Treasure Chest, Treasure Map). This can create unexpected twists in the game, as his card could potentially win the trick without following the usual rules.

### Example:
For instance, if you lead with a green 7, and you play a yellow 12, Graybeard could flip over a black 2. Even though the black 2 is lower than both your cards, it would win the trick because it is a trump card. This unpredictability can be used to your advantage or create challenges, depending on the cards in play.

### Contextual Strategy:
When playing against Graybeard, consider how his card choices might disrupt your strategy. Since he plays to aggravate, think about how you can anticipate his moves. If you have a strong hand, you might want to lead with a high card to secure the trick, but be mindful that Graybeard's card could change the outcome unexpectedly. Always keep track of what cards have been played to gauge the likelihood of Graybeard winning a trick and adjust your strategy accordingly. 

In summary, Graybeard does not follow suit, and his unpredictable play can significantly impact the flow of the game, so plan your moves with that in mind!",0.99999999998,0.36,0.8550383842768553

This means that when Graybeard plays the Tigress, it does not compete to win the trick; instead, it is used to avoid winning. 

### Game Rule Explanation:
1. **Tigress Card Functionality**: The Tigress can be declared as either a Pirate or an Escape when played. However, since Graybeard does not have the ability to strategize, he will always play the Tigress as an Escape. This means that it will lose to any other card played in that trick, unless the other cards are also Escape cards, in which case the first Escape card played wins the trick.

2. **Graybeard's Play**: When Graybeard plays his Tigress, it does not contribute to winning the trick. Instead, it serves to ensure that he does not win any tricks, which aligns with his role of aggravating the other players. 

3. **Trick Resolution**: If you lead with a card and Graybeard plays the Tigress as an Escape, you will need to consider your own cards carefully. If you want to win the trick, you should play a higher card than what Graybeard has played, knowing that his Tigress will not help him win.

### Contextual Strategy/Advice:
When playing against Graybeard, keep in mind that his Tigress will always be a non-winning card. Use this to your advantage by leading with strong cards when you suspect he might play the Tigress. If you have a strong hand, you can play aggressively, knowing that Graybeard's card will not affect your chances of winning the trick.

### Example:
Imagine you lead a trick with a Pirate card, and Graybeard plays the Tigress as an Escape. You can confidently play another Pirate card or even the Skull King, knowing that Graybeard's Tigress will not win the trick. This allows you to control the flow of the game and potentially secure the tricks you need to fulfill your bid.

In summary, when Graybeard plays the Tigress, treat it as a card that will not win the trick, and plan your plays accordingly to maximize your chances of winning the tricks you need!",0.99999999998,1.0,0.9406265514656736

3. **Scoring**: Since Graybeard does not bid or score, his presence is meant to create chaos and potentially disrupt your plans. His cards can win tricks, which might affect your ability to fulfill your bid.

### Contextual Strategy/Advice:
When playing against Graybeard, consider how his unpredictable card plays can influence your strategy. Since he does not follow suit, you might want to hold onto your higher cards for when you anticipate he will play a weaker card. Also, keep in mind that if he wins a trick, he will lead the next one, which could give him an advantage in controlling the flow of the game.

For instance, if you lead with a high card and Graybeard follows with a lower card, you might win that trick. However, if he plays a card that unexpectedly wins, he will lead the next trick, potentially forcing you to play defensively. Always be prepared for his card to disrupt your plans!

This is a trick-taking game where players must bid the exact number of tricks they believe they can win, and the player with the highest score at the end of the game is declared the winner and earns the title of Captain of the Seven Seas!

### Game Rule Explanation:
1. **Bidding**: At the start of each round, after cards are dealt, players will secretly bid on how many tricks they think they will win. You can bid any number from 0 up to the total number of cards you have in that round. 

2. **Playing Tricks**: Players take turns playing one card at a time, and the player who plays the highest card of the leading suit wins the trick. However, special cards like the Skull King and Pirate cards can change the dynamics of who wins a trick.

3. **Scoring**: After all tricks have been played, scoring occurs. You earn points only if you meet your bid exactly. If you miss your bid by even one trick, you will lose points. This scoring system encourages careful consideration of your bids and the cards you play.

### Contextual Strategy/Advice:
To maximize your chances of winning, consider the following strategies:
- **Observe Opponents**: Pay attention to how many tricks your opponents are bidding. If they are bidding high, it may be wise to bid lower and try to disrupt their plans.
- **Card Management**: Keep track of which cards have been played, especially the high-value cards. This will help you gauge the likelihood of winning future tricks.
- **Use Special Cards Wisely**: The Skull King and Pirate cards can be game-changers. Use them strategically to either secure a trick or to thwart an opponent's bid.

### Example:
For instance, if you have a hand that includes a mix of high and low cards, you might bid conservatively, predicting that you can win 2 tricks. If you notice that your opponents are also bidding high, you might adjust your strategy to play defensively, aiming to win just enough tricks to meet your bid without overcommitting.

By focusing on your bids and the dynamics of the game, you can navigate through the rounds effectively and increase your chances of becoming the Captain of the Seven Seas!",0.99999999998,0.44,0.9999999999999996

Here’s how players typically approach this decision:

### Game Rule Explanation:
1. **Assess Your Hand**: After the cards are dealt, take a moment to evaluate the strength of your hand. The higher the card values, the more likely you are to win tricks. Remember that the game includes special cards like the Skull King and Pirate cards, which can affect your strategy.

2. **Bidding Process**: Each player will secretly decide how many tricks they believe they can win in that round. You can bid any number from 0 to the total number of cards dealt that round (which increases by one each round, starting from 1). If you feel confident, you might bid high, but if your hand is weak, you might consider bidding zero.

3. **Bidding Zero**: If you choose to bid zero, you must aim to take no tricks at all. If you succeed, you earn points based on the number of cards dealt that round (10 points per card). However, if you take even one trick, you will lose points based on the same formula, making zero bids a high-risk, high-reward strategy.

4. **Recording Bids**: Once everyone has made their bids, players reveal them simultaneously by either extending fingers for their bid or showing a closed fist for a zero bid. It’s important to have someone record these bids on the scorepad for tracking.

### Contextual Strategy/Advice:
- **Consider the Round Number**: As the game progresses, the number of cards dealt increases, which can affect your bidding strategy. In the earlier rounds, you might want to be more conservative, while in later rounds, you might feel more confident to bid higher.

- **Observe Opponents**: Pay attention to how your opponents are bidding. If they are consistently overbidding or underbidding, you can adjust your strategy accordingly. For example, if you notice a player often bids high but fails to meet their bid, you might want to bid lower to capitalize on their mistakes.

- **Card Counting**: Keep track of the cards that have been played, especially the high-value cards. This can give you insight into the likelihood of winning tricks as the round progresses.

### Example:
Imagine you have a hand with a mix of high and low cards, including a Skull King. You might decide to bid 3 tricks, believing that your high cards will help you win those tricks. If you successfully take exactly 3 tricks, you’ll earn 60 points (20 points per trick). However, if you take only 2 tricks, you’ll lose 10 points for each trick you were off, resulting in a -10 point score for that round.

By carefully evaluating your hand and considering the dynamics of the game, you can make informed bids that maximize your scoring potential. Happy sailing, and may you outsmart your fellow pirates!",0.99999999998,0.9210526315789473,0.9038950095906056

1. **Winning the Exact Number of Tricks**: If you successfully win the exact number of tricks you bid, you earn **20 points for each trick taken**. For example, if you bid 3 and take 3 tricks, you score 60 points (20 × 3).

2. **Winning More or Fewer Tricks**: If you capture more or fewer tricks than you bid, you will **lose points**. Specifically, you lose **10 points for each trick you were off** from your bid. This means:
   - If you bid 2 tricks but ended up taking 4 tricks, you were off by 2 tricks, resulting in a loss of 20 points (-10 × 2).
   - Conversely, if you bid 3 tricks but only took 1, you would also lose 20 points for being off by 2 tricks.

3. **No Points for Extra Tricks**: It's important to note that you do not earn any points for tricks captured beyond your bid. The focus is solely on whether you met your bid.

### Strategy Considerations:
When making your bid, consider the strength of your hand and the likelihood of winning the number of tricks you predict. If you feel uncertain, it might be wise to bid conservatively or even consider a zero bid if you believe you can avoid winning any tricks.

### Example for Clarity:
Imagine you bid 4 tricks but only manage to win 2. You would be off by 2 tricks, resulting in a score of -20 points for that round. This emphasizes the risk of overestimating your hand's strength.

Here’s how you can effectively do this:

### Game Rule Explanation

1. **Bidding Phase**: At the start of each round, players must bid on how many tricks they believe they can win. The key to sinking your opponents lies in making accurate bids. If you can predict your success accurately while your opponents misjudge theirs, you can gain a significant scoring advantage.

2. **Winning Tricks**: During the trick-taking phase, players play cards in a clockwise order. The player who plays the highest-ranking card wins the trick. If you can win tricks while your opponents fail to meet their bids, you can effectively ""sink"" their scores. 

3. **Scoring**: If you win the exact number of tricks you bid, you earn all potential points for that round. If you miss your bid by two or more, you score nothing, which can be devastating for your opponents if they miscalculate. 

### Contextual Strategy/Advice

- **Observe Opponents' Bids**: Pay close attention to how your opponents bid. If they bid high but seem to have weak cards, you might want to play conservatively and aim to win just enough tricks to meet your own bid while denying them their expected wins.

- **Play High Cards Wisely**: Use your high-ranking cards strategically. If you suspect an opponent will lead with a lower card, you can play a high card to win the trick and potentially disrupt their plans.

- **Utilize Special Cards**: If you’re playing with advanced rules, cards like the Kraken and White Whale can change the dynamics of a trick. If you can play these cards effectively, you can control the flow of the game and potentially force your opponents into unfavorable positions.

### Example

Imagine you bid 3 tricks, and your opponent bids 5. If you manage to win exactly 3 tricks while your opponent only wins 4, they will score a ""Complete Miss"" for their bid, earning them no points. Meanwhile, you would earn the full potential points for your successful bid, putting you in a strong position for that round.

Here’s how scoring works and what factors contribute to a player's final score:

### Game Rule Explanation:
1. **Bidding and Tricks**: At the beginning of each round, players bid on the number of tricks they believe they will win. If a player wins exactly the number of tricks they bid, they earn points for that round. However, if they miss their bid by even one trick, they lose points.

2. **Scoring Points**:
   - **Correct Bids**: Players earn points based on their bids. The exact scoring can vary depending on the scoring system you choose, but generally, successful bids yield positive points.
   - **Incorrect Bids**: If a player fails to meet their bid, they lose points. This can significantly impact their overall score.
   - **Character Cards**: Players can also earn bonus points by capturing character cards during tricks:
     - **Mermaids**: +20 points for each Mermaid taken by a Pirate.
     - **Pirates**: +30 points for each Pirate taken by the Skull King.
     - **Skull King with a Mermaid**: +40 points for taking the Skull King with a Mermaid.

3. **End of Game**: After the 10th round, tally up all the points from each round, including any bonuses from character cards. The player with the highest total score at the end of the game is declared the winner and earns the title of Captain of the Seven Seas!

### Contextual Strategy/Advice:
As you progress through the rounds, keep a close eye on both your own bids and those of your opponents. It’s crucial to balance your bids based on your hand strength and the cards that have already been played. If you notice that opponents are consistently underbidding or overbidding, you can adjust your strategy to capitalize on their mistakes. Additionally, aim to capture character cards when possible, as they can provide significant bonuses that can swing the score in your favor.

### Example:
For instance, if you bid 3 tricks and successfully win exactly 3 tricks, you will score points for that round. However, if you only win 2 tricks, you will lose points for not meeting your bid. If during that round you also captured a Mermaid, you would add the bonus points for that character card to your score, potentially mitigating the loss from your incorrect bid.

For instance, if you have a special card that allows you to break the usual rules of following suit, you can play it strategically to win a trick even if you don't have the leading suit. This can be particularly useful if you anticipate that a high-value card is about to be played.

With these preparations and insights, you’re ready to set sail on your adventure in **Skull King**! Enjoy the game!",0.99999999998,0.8181818181818182,0.8273089648109072

### When to Use Each Card:

1. **Blank Cards**: 
   - These are not used in standard gameplay but can be utilized to replace lost or damaged cards. Additionally, players can create custom cards if they wish, but this is entirely optional and not part of the standard rules.

2. **Loot Cards**: 
   - Loot cards come into play during the advanced rules. When you play a Loot card, you form an alliance with the player who captures it. If both players bid correctly, they each earn **20 bonus points**. This adds a layer of strategy, as you must coordinate your bids with your ally.

3. **Kraken**: 
   - The Kraken is also introduced in the advanced rules. When played, it destroys the entire trick, meaning no one wins that round, and the cards are set aside. The next trick is led by the player who would have won the trick if the Kraken hadn’t been played. This card can significantly disrupt the flow of the game, so use it wisely!

4. **White Whale**: 
   - Similar to the Kraken, the White Whale is part of the advanced rules. It affects both special and numbered suits. When played, special cards are rendered ineffective, and the highest numbered card wins the trick, regardless of suit. If only special cards are played, the trick is discarded, and the player who played the White Whale leads the next trick. This card can turn the tide of a round dramatically.

### Strategic Considerations:
- When you decide to incorporate the Kraken and White Whale, consider starting with just one to gauge how your group handles the added complexity. Both cards can create chaotic scenarios, so understanding their impact on your strategy is crucial.
- Forming alliances with Loot cards can be beneficial, but ensure that your partner is on the same page regarding bids to maximize your points.
- Timing the use of the Kraken or White Whale can be pivotal. If you anticipate a strong play from opponents, deploying the Kraken can nullify their efforts, while the White Whale can help you secure a trick when you have a high numbered card.

### Example:
Imagine you’re in a round where you suspect your opponents are holding strong cards. If you play the Kraken, you effectively reset the trick, allowing you to lead the next one with a fresh strategy. Conversely, if you have the White Whale and see a lot of special cards being played, you can confidently play it to ensure your numbered card wins the trick.

By understanding when and how to use these cards, you can enhance your gameplay and increase your chances of victory in **Skull King**!",0.99999999998,0.9047619047619048,0.9217507295402246

2. **Distribute the Cards**: Each player should receive one player aid card and a set of bid reminder cards. This will allow everyone to have a handy reference for the rules and the bidding process throughout the game.

3. **Store Remaining Cards**: Any leftover player aids and bid cards should be placed back in the box. This keeps the playing area organized and ensures that only the necessary components are in play.

4. **Prepare for Bidding**: Once everyone has their player aids and bid cards, you can proceed to the bidding phase. Remember, the bidding is a critical part of the game where players predict how many tricks they will win based on the strength of their hands.

1. **Remove Specific Cards**: Before you shuffle the deck, ensure that you have removed the following cards: the Blank cards, the Loot cards, the Kraken, and the White Whale. These cards are not used in the basic game and will be introduced later when you learn the advanced rules.

2. **Shuffle the Remaining Deck**: Once you have the correct cards, shuffle the remaining deck thoroughly. This ensures that the cards are well mixed and adds an element of unpredictability to the game.

3. **Deal the Cards**: After shuffling, you will deal cards to each player. The number of cards dealt will increase by one each round, starting from a base number determined by the first round. For example, if you start with 2 cards in the first round, the next round will have 3 cards, and so on, up to a maximum of 10 cards in the tenth round.

4. **Prepare for Bidding**: Once the cards are dealt, players will study their hands and prepare for the bidding phase. Make sure everyone is clear on how to indicate their bids using the bid reminder cards.

### Example of Deck Preparation:
If you are starting with 2 cards per player in the first round, after removing the specified cards, you would shuffle the remaining cards and then deal 2 cards to each player. In the next round, you would deal 3 cards to each player, and so forth.

### Strategic Insight:
As you prepare the deck and move into the bidding phase, consider the strength of your hand. Higher-value cards increase your chances of winning tricks, so think carefully about how many tricks you believe you can win based on the cards you have. This will inform your bid and set the stage for your strategy in the upcoming tricks.

This is a crucial aspect of the game, as capturing character cards can significantly boost your score.

### Game Rule Explanation:
- **Character Cards**: The rules specify that capturing character cards provides bonus points. Specifically, if a Pirate wins a trick that includes a Mermaid, the player controlling the Pirate will receive 20 points for that Mermaid.
- **Winning Tricks**: Remember that Pirates beat all numbered cards, and if multiple Pirates are played in a trick, the first one played wins. This means timing and strategy in playing your Pirates can be essential to maximize your points.

### Contextual Strategy/Advice:
When planning your moves, consider the potential for capturing Mermaids with your Pirates. If you suspect that your opponents may play Mermaids, you might want to hold onto your Pirates until the right moment to ensure you can capture those Mermaids for the bonus points. Additionally, if you have a strong hand with multiple Pirates, you can create pressure on your opponents, forcing them to play their Mermaids early or risk losing them.

### Example:
Imagine you lead a trick with a Pirate, and your opponent plays a Mermaid. If you have another Pirate to follow, you can capture that Mermaid and earn those 20 points. If you play strategically, you can also use your Pirates to control the flow of the game, ensuring you maximize your point potential while minimizing your opponents' opportunities.

This is a specific scoring rule that rewards players for capturing the Skull King character card itself, which adds an exciting layer to the trick-taking mechanics of the game.

### Game Rule Explanation:
To clarify, the Skull King card is a powerful card in the game, and capturing it can significantly impact your score. The point values for character cards are as follows:
- **30 points** for each Pirate taken by the Skull King.
- **40 points** for taking the Skull King with a Mermaid.
- **30 points** for taking the Skull King with the Skull King itself.

This means that if you successfully win a trick with the Skull King card, you will score those 30 points in addition to any other points you might earn from the trick itself.

### Contextual Strategy/Advice:
When considering your bids and plays, keep in mind the value of character cards, especially the Skull King. If you have the Skull King in your hand, it can be a strong play to lead with it if you believe you can win the trick. However, be cautious of your opponents' potential plays, as they may have cards that can outmatch the Skull King. 

### Example:
Imagine you are in a round where you have the Skull King and you predict you will win a certain number of tricks. If you lead with the Skull King and win the trick, you will score those 30 points. If you also correctly bid the number of tricks you intended to win, you will maximize your score for that round.

### Game Rule Explanation:
To clarify, the scoring for character cards in *Skull King* is as follows:
- **Mermaids** can capture **Pirates** for **20 points** each.
- **Skull King** can capture **Pirates** for **30 points** each.
- The special case occurs when you use a **Mermaid** to take the **Skull King**, which grants you the **40-point bonus**.

### Contextual Strategy/Advice:
When playing, consider the timing of your bids and the cards you play. If you have a Mermaid and see the Skull King being played, it might be worth holding onto your Mermaid until the right moment to maximize your points. Additionally, keep an eye on your opponents' bids and the cards they play, as this can inform your strategy on when to play your high-value cards.

### Example:
Imagine you are in a round where the Skull King is played, and you have a Mermaid in your hand. If you play your Mermaid after the Skull King has been played, you will successfully capture it and score those valuable 40 points. However, if the Skull King is not played, or if you play your Mermaid too early, you might miss out on that opportunity.

In summary, capturing the Skull King with a Mermaid is a powerful move that can significantly boost your score, so plan your plays carefully!",0.99999999998,0.631578947368421,0.9041459853625532

This means that regardless of who plays first, second, or last in a trick, the bonuses for capturing character cards are awarded based solely on the cards played and the outcomes of those plays.

### Game Rule Explanation:
When you capture character cards, you can earn bonus points as follows:
- **20 points** for each Mermaid taken by a Pirate.
- **30 points** for each Pirate taken by the Skull King.
- **40 points** for taking the Skull King with a Mermaid.

The key takeaway here is that the order in which players play their cards does not influence the bonuses. For example, if you play a Mermaid and capture the Skull King, you will still earn the 40 points for that capture, regardless of whether you played first or last in that round.

### Example:
Let’s say Lawrence leads with a yellow 14, Charlotte plays a Pirate, and Anne plays the Skull King. If Morgan then plays a Mermaid and wins the trick, she will earn points for the yellow 14 and the bonus for capturing the Skull King with the Mermaid. The order of play did not impact Morgan's ability to earn those bonuses; it was solely based on the cards played.

### Contextual Strategy/Advice:
When planning your strategy, focus on the cards you have and how they can interact with your opponents' plays. Since the order of play does not affect bonus points, consider how you can leverage your cards to capture valuable character cards, regardless of when you play them. Pay attention to what your opponents are playing, as this can help you decide when to play your stronger cards or when to hold back to maximize your scoring potential.

1. **Points for Winning the Trick**: Morgan played a Mermaid and won the trick against a yellow 14 card, which is worth **10 points**.

2. **Bonus for Taking the Skull King**: Since Morgan took the Skull King with her Mermaid, she earns an additional **40 points** for this specific action.

Now, let's sum it up:
- Points for winning the trick (yellow 14): **10 points**
- Bonus for taking the Skull King with a Mermaid: **40 points**

So, **10 + 40 = 50 points** in total.

### Game Rule Explanation
In *Skull King*, character cards have specific interactions that can lead to significant point bonuses. The Mermaid, while generally weaker against Pirates, has the unique ability to capture the Skull King, which is the strongest card in the game. This interaction is crucial for maximizing your score.

### Contextual Strategy
When playing *Skull King*, always consider the potential of character cards in your hand. If you have a Mermaid, it can be a powerful tool not just for winning tricks but also for scoring high through bonuses. Timing your play of the Mermaid is essential; if you anticipate that the Skull King will be played, holding onto your Mermaid until the right moment can turn the tide in your favor.

### Example
Imagine a scenario where you suspect your opponents might play high-value cards. If you have a Mermaid, you can strategically wait to play it until you see the Skull King in play, ensuring you can capture it and gain those valuable bonus points.

See the advanced rules for instructions.""]","In the **Skull King's scoring system**, players earn points based on their bids and the character cards they capture during the round. Here’s how it works:

### Earning Points

1. **Bidding Correctly**: At the start of each round, players must bid the exact number of tricks they predict they will win. If you successfully win the number of tricks you bid, you earn points for those tricks. However, if you miss your bid by even one trick, you lose points equal to your bid. This creates a high-stakes environment where accurate predictions are crucial.

2. **Character Card Bonuses**: In addition to points earned from winning tricks, players can earn bonus points by capturing specific character cards:
   - **Mermaids**: If a Pirate captures a Mermaid, they earn **20 points** for each Mermaid taken.
   - **Pirates**: If the Skull King captures a Pirate, they earn **30 points** for each Pirate taken.
   - **Skull King with a Mermaid**: If a player takes the Skull King using a Mermaid, they earn a whopping **40 points**.

### Example of Scoring

Let’s say you bid to win 3 tricks in a round. If you successfully win exactly 3 tricks, you score points based on the tricks won. However, if you only win 2 tricks, you would lose points equal to your bid (3 points in this case). 

Now, consider character cards: If during the round you manage to capture a Mermaid with a Pirate, you would earn an additional 20 points. If you capture the Skull King with that same Mermaid, you would earn 40 points instead of the 20 points for the Mermaid alone, but you would not earn the 30 points for capturing a Pirate since the Skull King did not win the trick.

### Strategic Considerations

When making your bids, consider not only your hand but also the potential for capturing character cards. If you have a strong hand but also see opportunities to capture character cards, you might adjust your bid accordingly. Balancing the risk of overbidding with the potential for bonuses can be key to maximizing your score.

Remember, the order of play does not affect the bonuses from character cards, so always keep an eye on what your opponents are playing and how you can leverage your cards to capture valuable character cards while sticking to your bid.

By understanding these scoring mechanics and strategically planning your bids and plays, you can navigate the treacherous waters of Skull King and aim for the title of Captain of the Seven Seas!",0.99999999998,0.8260869565217391,0.9478747173237886

However, seein' as ye don't have a sword, ye might face a mutiny if 'n you do...""]","In **Skull King**, if a player bids incorrectly, even by just 1 trick, the consequences depend on whether they bid one or more tricks or if they bid zero.

### Bidding One or More Tricks:
When a player bids a certain number of tricks and then takes either more or fewer tricks than they bid, they will lose points. Specifically, for each trick they are off from their bid, they lose **10 points**. 

For example, if a player bids 3 tricks but ends up taking 4 tricks, they are off by 1 trick. Therefore, they would lose **10 points** for that round. Conversely, if they bid 3 but only take 2 tricks, they would also lose **10 points** for being off by 1.

### Bidding Zero:
If a player bids zero and they take zero tricks, they score **10 points for each card dealt that round**. However, if they bid zero and then take 1 or more tricks, they incur a penalty of **10 points for each card dealt that round**. This can lead to significant negative scores if they miscalculate their ability to take tricks.

### Example:
Let’s say it’s round 5, and a player bids zero but ends up taking 2 tricks. Since 5 cards were dealt, they would lose **50 points** (10 points x 5 cards) for their incorrect bid. 

### Strategy Advice:
When considering your bid, think carefully about your hand and the likelihood of winning tricks. If you feel uncertain about your ability to meet your bid, especially if you’re considering a zero bid, weigh the risks of potential penalties against the rewards of scoring points accurately.

### Game Rule Explanation:
1. **Classic Scoring System**: This method is designed for bold and casual play. In this system, you only earn points for the round if you bid correctly. If you miss your bid by even one trick, you lose points. This creates a high-risk, high-reward scenario where players must be confident in their predictions. For example, if you bid 3 tricks and only win 2, you would lose points, making it crucial to gauge your hand and the potential of your opponents accurately.

2. **Cunning Scoring System**: This method is more suited for cautious players. Here, every player has the same potential points based on the number of cards dealt, regardless of their bid. You can earn 10 points for each card dealt that round. If you bid correctly (a Direct Hit), you earn all potential points; if you're off by one (a Glancing Blow), you earn half; and if you're off by two or more (a Complete Miss), you earn none. This system allows for a more strategic approach, where players can focus on accuracy rather than taking risks with their bids.

### Contextual Strategy/Advice:
If you prefer a more cautious approach, consider using the cunning scoring system. This allows you to focus on accurately predicting your wins without the fear of losing points for being slightly off. Pay attention to the cards played and the bidding patterns of your opponents to refine your predictions. 

Conversely, if you enjoy the thrill of risk, the classic scoring system might be more appealing. In this case, assess your hand and the dynamics of the table carefully. If you feel confident about your ability to win a certain number of tricks, don’t hesitate to bid boldly, but be prepared for the consequences if your predictions don’t pan out.

### Example:
Imagine you’re in a round where 5 cards are dealt. If you’re using the cunning scoring system and bid 3 tricks, you have the potential to score 50 points if you hit your bid exactly. If you win 2 tricks, you would earn 25 points (half of the potential). However, if you were using the classic scoring system and bid 3 but only won 2, you would lose points instead, emphasizing the need for careful consideration in your bidding.

In summary, the scoring system in *Skull King* can be tailored to your play style—whether you prefer the excitement of bold bids or the strategic precision of cautious play.

Let’s break down how this works based on the rules you've provided.

### Game Rule Explanation

1. **Bidding Correctly**: 
   - If you bid the exact number of tricks you win, you earn **20 points for each trick taken**. For example, if you bid 3 and successfully take 3 tricks, you score 60 points (20 points x 3 tricks).
   - If you capture more or fewer tricks than you bid, you lose **10 points for each trick you were off**. For instance, if you bid 2 but took 4 tricks, you would be off by 2 and lose 20 points (-10 points x 2).

2. **Bidding Zero**: 
   - If you bid zero and correctly take zero tricks, your score is **10 points times the number of cards dealt that round**. For example, in round 7, if you bid zero and take zero tricks, you score 70 points (10 x 7).
   - However, if you bid zero and take one or more tricks, you incur a penalty of **10 points for each card dealt that round**. So, if you bid zero in round 9 and took 2 tricks, you would lose 90 points (-10 x 9).

3. **Bonus Points**: 
   - In addition to the points earned from your bid, you can earn bonus points based on your accuracy. If you get your bid exactly right (a Direct Hit), you earn all potential round points. If you are off by 1 (a Glancing Blow), you earn half of the potential points. If you miss by 2 or more (a Complete Miss), you earn none of the potential points.

### Contextual Strategy/Advice

When considering your bids, think about the number of cards dealt and your confidence in winning tricks. If you feel uncertain about your ability to win the exact number of tricks, a zero bid can be a strategic gamble, especially in rounds with a high card count. However, be cautious, as taking even one trick when bidding zero can lead to significant point losses.

### Example

Let’s say you are in round 5, and you see that 5 cards will be dealt. If you bid 2 and manage to take exactly 2 tricks, you would score 60 points (20 points x 3 tricks). If you bid 2 but take 4 tricks, you would lose 20 points. Conversely, if you bid zero and take no tricks, you would score 50 points (10 x 5). 

Understanding these relationships and how they affect your scoring will help you make more informed decisions during the game. Always weigh the risks and rewards of your bids based on your hand and the dynamics of the game!",0.99999999998,0.72,0.876544016778861

Here’s how it works:

1. **Playing the Loot Card**: When you play a loot card during a trick, you are signaling your intention to form an alliance with the player who wins that trick. This means that if both you and that player bid correctly for the round, you will each receive **20 bonus points**.

2. **Winning the Trick**: If you lead the trick with a loot card and the cards that follow are all escape cards, you will win the trick. However, in this case, no alliance is formed, and thus, no bonus points are awarded. This is an important strategic consideration—leading with a loot card can be a powerful move, but you need to be aware of what cards your opponents might play.

3. **Bidding Correctly**: To benefit from the alliance formed by the loot card, both you and the player who captures the loot card must have bid correctly for the round. If one of you misses your bid, the bonus points are not awarded.

### Example:
Imagine you play a loot card and your friend captures it. If both of you had bid accurately for the number of tricks you expected to win, you would each score those 20 bonus points at the end of the round. However, if you led with the loot card and the subsequent cards played were all escape cards, you would win the trick but miss out on the bonus since no alliance was formed.

### Strategic Advice:
When considering playing a loot card, think about your current bid and the bids of your opponents. If you suspect that your ally will also bid correctly, it can be a great way to boost your score. However, be cautious about leading with a loot card if you think your opponents might play escape cards, as this could prevent you from forming an alliance and earning those valuable bonus points.

In summary, playing a loot card can be a strategic move to gain bonus points, but it requires careful consideration of your bids and the cards played in the trick.",0.99999999998,0.5,0.8998263641453051

Here’s how it works:

### Game Rule Explanation:
When you play a loot card, you form an alliance with the player who captures that loot card. For both players to earn the bonus points associated with the loot card, they must correctly bid on the number of tricks they expect to win in that round. If both players bid accurately, they each receive **20 bonus points**.

However, if you lead a trick with a loot card and the cards that follow are all escape cards (which are typically lower in value), you will win the trick, but no alliance is formed, and thus no bonus points are awarded. This means that the strategic use of loot cards can significantly impact your scoring, especially if you can coordinate with another player to ensure both of you bid correctly.

### Contextual Strategy/Advice:
When considering the use of loot cards, think about the potential for forming alliances with other players. If you suspect that another player may also be using a loot card, it might be beneficial to communicate your intentions subtly through your bids. Additionally, keep an eye on the cards being played after your loot card; if you lead with a loot card, be prepared for the possibility that the following cards could affect your ability to win the trick and form an alliance.

### Example:
Imagine you play a loot card and another player captures it. If both of you bid correctly, you each get those 20 bonus points. However, if you lead with that loot card and the subsequent cards played are all escape cards, you win the trick but miss out on the bonus because the alliance wasn’t formed. This highlights the importance of timing and understanding the flow of the game when using loot cards.

In summary, leverage loot cards wisely, coordinate with your fellow players, and ensure your bids align to maximize your bonus points!",0.99999999998,0.47619047619047616,0.9612801138433938

According to the rules, if you play a loot card to lead the trick, you will win the trick only if all the cards played after yours are **escape cards**. 

Here’s how it works:

1. **Leading with a Loot Card**: When you play a loot card, you initiate the trick. This sets the stage for the other players to follow.
   
2. **Following Cards**: After you lead with the loot card, each player in clockwise order must play a card. If all players play escape cards (which are typically cards that do not have a number and are not part of the standard suits), then you win the trick.

3. **No Alliance Formed**: It's important to note that if you win the trick this way, no alliance is formed, and thus, you do not earn the bonus points associated with loot cards. The bonus points are only awarded if both you and the player who captures the loot card bid correctly.

### Example:
Imagine you lead with a loot card. The next player plays an escape card, the following player also plays an escape card, and the last player does the same. Since all cards played after your loot card are escapes, you win the trick. However, if any player plays a numbered card or a trump card (the Jolly Roger), you would lose the trick to the highest card played.

### Strategic Insight:
When considering leading with a loot card, assess the likelihood of your opponents having escape cards. If you suspect they might play numbered or trump cards, it may be wiser to hold onto your loot card for a more favorable moment or to use it strategically to form alliances later in the round.

### Game Rule Explanation:
When you play a loot card, you initiate a potential alliance with the player who captures it. If both players involved in the alliance bid correctly, they each receive **20 bonus points**. However, if the trick consists solely of escape cards following the loot card, the loot card will win the trick because it is the highest card played. The key detail here is that since no other cards that could form an alliance (like another loot card) are played, the bonus points are not awarded.

### Example:
Imagine you lead with a loot card, and the next player plays an escape card. If the following players also play escape cards, you will win the trick with your loot card. However, since no other loot cards were played, you and the other players do not form an alliance, and thus, you do not receive the bonus points.

### Contextual Strategy/Advice:
When considering playing a loot card, think about the potential outcomes based on the cards you suspect your opponents might have. If you believe they have escape cards, leading with a loot card can be a strategic move to secure a trick without risking an alliance. However, be cautious about your bids; if you lead with a loot card but end up winning the trick without forming an alliance, it could affect your overall score if you were aiming to win fewer tricks than you bid.

It consists of each player, in clockwise order, playing one card face-up to the table. The player who plays the highest-valued card wins that trick and collects the cards played during that round into a stack in front of them. 

### How a Trick is Won:
1. **Leading the Trick**: The player to the left of the dealer starts by playing a card face-up. This card sets the ""lead"" for the trick.
2. **Following Suit**: Each subsequent player must play a card of the same suit if they have one. If they do not have a card of the leading suit, they can play any card, including a trump card (the black-bordered Jolly Roger cards), which will win the trick unless another trump card is played.
3. **Winning the Trick**: The player who plays the highest-ranking card of the leading suit wins the trick. If a trump card is played, it automatically wins the trick unless another trump card of a higher value is played.

### Example:
Let’s say the leading card is a Green 10. If Player A plays a Green 12, Player B plays a Red 9, and Player C plays a Black Jolly Roger (trump), Player C wins the trick because the trump card beats all other suits.

### Strategy Tips:
- **Bidding Wisely**: Before the tricks begin, assess your hand carefully to determine how many tricks you can realistically win. Remember, if you win exactly the number of tricks you bid, you score points; if you miss your bid, you lose points.
- **Card Management**: Keep track of which suits have been played and the cards that have already won tricks. This can help you predict what cards your opponents might have left and adjust your strategy accordingly.

Specifically, the round number corresponds to the number of cards each player receives. For instance, in the first round, each player is dealt 1 card, leading to 1 trick being played. In the second round, each player receives 2 cards, resulting in 2 tricks, and so on.

To clarify, if you are in the third round, each player will receive 3 cards, which means there will be 3 tricks played during that round. The round concludes once all the cards dealt have been played, and players will then score based on their bids and the number of tricks they actually won.

### Strategic Insight:
Understanding how many tricks will be played is crucial for making informed bids. As you assess your hand, consider the value of the cards you hold and how they might perform against the cards your opponents might play. This knowledge can help you gauge whether to bid conservatively or take a risk with a higher bid.

### Example:
If you are in the fifth round, each player will receive 5 cards, leading to 5 tricks. If you feel confident in your hand, you might bid 3 tricks, aiming to win exactly that number for maximum points. However, if you suspect your opponents have strong cards, you might choose to bid lower to avoid penalties for missing your bid.

### Beginning of a Round:
1. **Dealing Cards**: The new dealer, who is the player to the left of the previous dealer, shuffles all the cards, including those played in the previous round. They then deal cards to each player, increasing the number of cards dealt by one from the previous round. For example, if you played the first round with 1 card each, the second round will have 2 cards each, and so on, up to a maximum of 10 cards in the tenth round.

2. **Bidding**: After the cards are dealt, players make their bids, predicting how many tricks they believe they can win during that round. This is a critical moment as it sets the stage for scoring later.

### End of a Round:
1. **Playing Tricks**: Once bidding is complete, the player to the left of the dealer leads the first trick by playing a card face up. Players then play cards in clockwise order, following the rules of leading and following suit. The player who plays the highest-ranking card wins the trick and collects the cards.

2. **Scoring**: After all tricks in the round have been played, players tally their scores based on their bids and the number of tricks they actually won. This includes calculating any bonus points earned. The scores are recorded on the scoresheet, which tracks each player's performance throughout the game.

3. **Transition to the Next Round**: After scoring, the player to the left of the dealer becomes the new dealer for the next round. They will again shuffle and deal cards, continuing the cycle until all ten rounds are completed.

### Example of Scoring:
If you bid to win 3 tricks and you successfully win exactly 3 tricks, you achieve a ""Direct Hit,"" earning all potential points for that round. If you win 2 tricks, that would be a ""Glancing Blow,"" and you would earn half of the potential points. If you win 0 tricks, that’s a ""Complete Miss,"" and you earn no points.

### Strategic Advice:
As you prepare for the next round, consider how your bidding strategy aligns with your hand. If you have strong cards, you might want to bid higher, but if your hand is weak, it may be wise to underbid to avoid penalties. Pay attention to the cards played in previous rounds to gauge the strength of your opponents' hands and adjust your strategy accordingly.

By understanding these mechanics and strategies, you can navigate the beginning and end of each round effectively, setting yourself up for success in **Skull King**!",0.99999999998,1.0,0.8956222034457468

Here’s how it works and its significance compared to the other suits:

### Game Rule Explanation

1. **Trump Suit Mechanics**: The Jolly Roger cards outrank all other suits (Parrot, Treasure Chest, and Treasure Map). This means that if a Jolly Roger card is played in a trick, it will win against any numbered card from the other suits, regardless of the number on that card. For example, if a player leads with a yellow 12 and another player follows with a black 2, the black 2 will win the trick, even though it is a lower number.

2. **Following Suit**: When a suit card is led, players must follow suit if they have a card of that suit. If they do not have a card of the led suit, they can play any other card, including a Jolly Roger card. This ability to play a trump card when unable to follow suit can be a strategic advantage.

3. **Winning Tricks**: If all players play cards of the same suit, the highest numbered card wins the trick. However, if a Jolly Roger card is played, it automatically wins the trick unless another Jolly Roger card is played, in which case the last one played wins.

### Contextual Strategy/Advice

When considering your strategy, keep in mind the power of the trump suit. If you have Jolly Roger cards, you can use them to secure crucial tricks, especially if you anticipate that your opponents will play high-numbered cards from the other suits. 

Additionally, if you are leading a trick and have a Jolly Roger card, it can be advantageous to play it early to establish dominance in that round. However, be cautious about revealing your trump cards too soon, as they can be pivotal in later tricks.

### Example

Imagine you are in a situation where the first player leads with a green 10. You have a green 5 and a black 3. If you play the green 5, you will likely lose the trick unless no one else plays a higher green card. However, if you play the black 3, you will win the trick regardless of the other players' cards, as the Jolly Roger card trumps the green suit. 

Understanding the significance of the trump suit and how to leverage it effectively can greatly enhance your chances of winning tricks and ultimately the game.",0.99999999998,0.96875,0.8763305430539908

When you lead a trick, you are the first player to play a card face up in the center of the table. This action establishes the ""suit"" that other players must follow, unless a special card is played.

### Game Rule Explanation

1. **Leading a Trick**: The player to the left of the dealer starts the first trick by playing a card. This card can either be a suit card (numbered cards from 1-14 in one of the four colors) or a special card (like a Mermaid, Pirate, Skull King, etc.). 

2. **Following Suit**: If you lead with a suit card, all other players must play a card of the same suit if they have one. If they do not have a card of that suit, they can play any card from their hand. 

3. **Special Cards**: If you choose to lead with a special card, the rules change. For instance, if you lead with a Mermaid, Pirate, Skull King, or other special character, there is no suit to follow. This means that each player can play any card they choose, which can lead to more unpredictable outcomes.

4. **Winning the Trick**: The player who plays the highest-ranking card of the led suit (or the highest special card if applicable) wins the trick and collects the cards played in that trick. They then lead the next trick.

### Implications for Other Players

- **Strategic Considerations**: When you lead, you have the power to dictate the flow of the trick. If you lead with a strong suit card, you may force other players to play their high cards early, potentially leaving them vulnerable in later tricks. Conversely, leading with a special card can create chaos, as it allows players to play any card, which can be advantageous if you know your opponents' hands.

- **Reading Your Opponents**: The choice of card you lead with can give insights into your strategy. If you lead with a low suit card, it may indicate that you are trying to bait higher cards from your opponents. If you lead with a special card, it might suggest you have a strong hand and are confident in winning the trick regardless of what others play.

### Example

For instance, if you lead with a **Skull King**, all players can play any card they wish. If you suspect that your opponents have strong suit cards, leading with a special card can disrupt their plans and potentially allow you to win the trick with a lower card if they play their high cards in response.

In summary, leading a trick is not just about the card you play; it's about the strategy you employ and how you anticipate your opponents' responses. Use this to your advantage to control the game and maximize your chances of winning tricks!",0.99999999998,1.0,0.8922382952185273

This means that if a suit card is led (the first card played in a trick), players must play a card of the same suit if they have one in their hand. 

### Conditions for Following Suit:
1. **Leading with a Suit Card**: If the first player leads with a numbered card from one of the suits (Parrots, Pirates, etc.), all subsequent players must play a card from that same suit if they have it.
2. **Playing a Special Card**: If a player leads with a special card (like the Skull King or the Mermaid), the usual rules of following suit do not apply. Players can play any card they wish, regardless of the suit led.

### Example:
- If the first player leads with a **Green 5 (Parrots)**, and you have a **Green 3 (Parrots)** in your hand, you must play the Green 3. However, if you have no cards in the Green suit, you can play any card from your hand, including a special card or a card from another suit.

### Strategic Insight:
Understanding when to play special cards can be crucial. If you anticipate that you will not win the trick, leading with a special card can allow you to play more flexibly and potentially disrupt your opponents' plans. Conversely, if you have a strong suit and want to secure the trick, leading with a suit card can help you control the flow of the game.

1. **Classic Scoring System (Skull King's Scoring)**: This is the traditional method where you earn points based on your bidding accuracy. In this system, you must bid the exact number of tricks you expect to win in a round. If you hit your bid perfectly, you score points equal to the number of tricks you won. However, if you miss your bid—whether you win too few or too many tricks—you will lose points. This creates a high-stakes environment where players must carefully assess their hands and the potential plays of their opponents.

   - **Example**: If you bid 3 tricks and successfully win exactly 3 tricks, you score points for those tricks. But if you only win 2 tricks, you lose points for being off by 1.

2. **Alternative Scoring System**: While the specifics of this alternative system aren't detailed in your context, it typically allows for different scoring mechanics that may not penalize players as harshly for incorrect bids or may incorporate additional bonuses or multipliers based on the cards played or the tricks won. This system can be more forgiving and may encourage more aggressive play.

When deciding which scoring system to use, consider the group's play style. If your group enjoys a more competitive and risky game, the Classic Scoring System might be the way to go. If you prefer a more casual experience, the alternative system could be a better fit.

As you play, keep in mind that your bidding strategy should align with the scoring system in use. In the Classic Scoring System, it’s crucial to be realistic about your hand and the potential tricks you can win, while in the alternative system, you might feel freer to take risks without the fear of losing points for missed bids.

Here’s how it assists players:

### Game Rule Explanation
In *Skull King*, scoring can be quite intricate due to the nature of bidding and the penalties for incorrect bids. The app simplifies this by automatically calculating the points based on your bids and the tricks you actually win. You input your predicted number of tricks (your bid) and the actual number of tricks you won, and the app does the rest. 

For instance, if you bid 3 tricks and won 2, the app will deduct points according to the scoring rules, which state that you lose points for being off by even one trick. This eliminates the need for manual calculations, reducing the chances of errors and speeding up the game.

### Contextual Strategy/Advice
Using the app can also help you focus more on your strategy during the game rather than getting bogged down in arithmetic. Since the app keeps track of your running total and any bonuses you might earn, you can concentrate on your bidding strategy and how to outmaneuver your opponents. 

### Example
For example, if you’re in a round where you feel confident about winning a certain number of tricks, you can input your bid into the app. If you later realize that your opponents are playing aggressively and you might not meet your bid, you can adjust your strategy in real-time without worrying about recalculating scores manually.

When a special card is led, the rules for the suit in play are altered as follows:']","In **Skull King**, when you lead a trick, you have two primary options: you can play a suit card or a special card. Each choice has distinct implications for how the trick will be played.

### Leading with a Suit Card
If you choose to lead with a suit card (which includes the standard pirate cards), the other players must follow suit if they have a card of that suit in their hand. This means they must play a card from the same suit as the one you led with, which can help you control the flow of the trick and potentially secure it if you have the highest card in that suit.

### Leading with a Special Card
When you lead with a special card—such as a Mermaid, Pirate, Skull King, Tigress as a Pirate, Kraken, or White Whale—there are no suits to follow. This means that the other players can play any card they choose. Leading with a special card can be a strategic move, as it allows you to disrupt your opponents' plans and potentially catch them off guard. 

#### Special Card Effects:
- **Mermaid**: If led, it can win the trick unless someone plays a Skull King.
- **Skull King**: This card is very powerful and can win against all other cards except for a Mermaid.
- **Kraken**: This card can also change the dynamics of the trick, depending on the context of the game.

### Strategic Considerations
When deciding whether to lead with a suit card or a special card, consider your current hand and your bid for the round. If you are confident in winning the trick, leading with a special card can help you secure it without forcing others to follow suit. Conversely, if you need to maintain control over the trick, leading with a suit card might be the better option.

### Example
For instance, if you lead with a Skull King, your opponents can play any card, which might lead to unexpected outcomes. If they play a Mermaid in response, you could lose the trick despite leading with a powerful card. On the other hand, if you lead with a suit card and have the highest card in that suit, you can ensure that you win the trick and stay on track with your bid.

In summary, your choice of leading card can significantly influence the outcome of the trick and the overall round, so weigh your options carefully based on your hand and your strategy for the game!",0.99999999998,0.4827586206896552,0.9780673587009571

There are three standard suits; Parrot (green), Treasure  \n![7_image_0.png](7_image_0.png) Chest (yellow), Treasure Map (purple), and the trump suit: Jolly Roger (Black). Jolly Roger cards outrank (trump) the other three suits.  \n8 If a suit card is played first in a trick (lead), all players must 'follow suit' and play that same suit (if they are going to play a numbered card). If you don't have the suit that was lead, you may play any other suit. If all cards played are the same suit, the highest numbered card would win the trick. Cards without numbers are not suit cards and may be played regardless of what was led.  \nExample: Samuel plays a green 7, Bonny then lays down a green 12, and Henry plays a green 8. Bonny wins the trick.  \nWhen you play a different suit (non-trump) than the suit that's in play, your card will lose, even if it is the highest number played. Example: Scarlet plays a yellow 12 and Thomas plays a  \n![8_image_0.png](8_image_0.png) yellow 5. Jack doesn't have a yellow card and plays a purple 14.

Here’s how it works:

### Game Rule Explanation:
1. **Leading with a Special Card**: When you choose to lead with a special card (like an Escape, Tigress, or Loot), the normal rules of following suit do not apply in the same way they would if you led with a numbered suit card. Instead, the next player must set the suit that must be followed unless they also play a special card, which would then defer the suit-setting responsibility to the next player.

2. **Breaking the Rules**: Special cards allow players to break the standard rules governing numbered cards. This means that even if a player would normally be required to follow suit, they can play a special card instead. This can create strategic opportunities to control the flow of the trick.

### Contextual Strategy/Advice:
Using a special card to lead can be a powerful tactic. It allows you to dictate the terms of the trick and potentially force your opponents into a less advantageous position. If you have a strong hand and can anticipate what your opponents might play, leading with a special card can help you secure the trick more effectively.

### Example:
Imagine you lead with an Escape card. The next player, let’s say Player B, must now choose a suit to follow. If Player B plays a numbered card from a suit they have, they set the suit for the rest of the players. However, if Player B also plays a special card, they pass the responsibility to the next player, creating a chain of decisions that can lead to unexpected outcomes.

In summary, leading with a special card not only allows you to bypass the usual suit-following rules but also gives you the chance to manipulate the game dynamics in your favor. Use this to your advantage to control the flow of the game!",0.99999999998,1.0,0.8724630243339889

Join the Skull King family fun!""]","To unlock a pirate's unique skill in **Skull King**, you must first win a trick using that specific pirate card. This means that you need to play the pirate card in a trick and successfully win it, rather than just capturing the pirate card itself. Once you win a trick with the pirate, you can immediately use their ability, but keep in mind that this ability does not carry over to the next round.

Here's a breakdown of the process:

1. **Play the Pirate Card**: During your turn, you need to play the pirate card in a trick.
2. **Win the Trick**: Ensure that your pirate card wins the trick. Remember, pirate cards beat all numbered cards, and if multiple pirates are played, the first one played wins.
3. **Use the Ability**: After winning the trick, you can immediately use the pirate's unique ability.

For example, if you play **Rosie D' Laney** and win the trick, you can then choose any player (including yourself) to lead the next trick. However, if you play Rosie but do not win the trick, you won't be able to use her ability.

It's also important to note that **Harry the Giant** is unique in that his ability can be used after the final trick of a round, giving you a strategic advantage if you manage to win a trick with him.

In terms of strategy, consider the timing of when to play your pirate cards. If you suspect that your opponents might play strong cards, it might be wise to hold off on playing your pirate until you can ensure a win. Additionally, think about how using a pirate's ability can influence the flow of the game, especially in terms of who leads the next trick or how many cards you have in hand.

By carefully planning when to play your pirates and ensuring you win the tricks, you can effectively unlock and utilize their powerful abilities to gain an edge in the game!",0.99999999998,1.0,0.9527021885672579

### Game Rule Explanation:
To clarify, each pirate's ability must be used immediately after winning a trick with that pirate, and it does not carry over to the next round. However, Harry the Giant's ability is an exception, as it can be utilized after the final trick of the round, giving you a chance to influence your score based on the results of the round.

### Contextual Strategy/Advice:
When playing as Harry the Giant, consider how your final bid adjustment can impact your overall score. If you find yourself in a position where you have won several tricks but are unsure about your final score, using Harry's ability wisely can help you secure a better position in the game. Always keep track of your opponents' bids and the tricks they have won, as this will inform your decision on whether to increase or decrease your bid.

### Example:
For instance, if you initially bid 10 points and after the final tricks, you realize that you have won enough tricks to justify a higher score, you could choose to increase your bid to 11 points. Conversely, if you feel you might not have met your bid expectations, you could lower it to 9 points. This flexibility can be crucial in tight scoring situations.

Her ability allows you to **choose any player, including yourself, to lead the next trick**. This means that after you win a trick with Rosie, you can strategically decide who will start the next round of play.

### Game Rule Explanation:
To utilize Rosie D' Laney's ability, you must first win a trick while playing her. Once you have successfully done that, you can immediately activate her ability. This choice can be crucial, as leading a trick can allow you to control the pace of the game and potentially set up advantageous plays for yourself or your team.

### Contextual Strategy/Advice:
When considering who to choose as the leader for the next trick, think about the current hands of all players involved. If you believe that the player you choose has a weaker hand, you might want to lead them to potentially win the trick with less risk. Conversely, if you have a strong hand, you might want to lead yourself to maximize your chances of winning more tricks. 

Additionally, consider the cards that have already been played. If you know certain high-value cards are still in play, leading a player who might not have the strength to win could be beneficial. 

### Example:
For instance, if you have just won a trick with Rosie and you notice that your opponent has played several high cards, you might choose to lead them again, hoping they will struggle to win the next trick. Alternatively, if you have a strong hand and want to maintain control, you could lead yourself to ensure you can play your best cards.

Using Rosie D' Laney's ability effectively can turn the tide of the game, so always think strategically about your choice!",0.99999999998,0.631578947368421,0.9197702031633995

When you successfully win a trick with Bendt, you can use his ability immediately. Here’s how it works:

### **Bendt the Bandit's Ability:**
- **Action**: You add 2 cards to your hand from the deck.
- **Follow-Up**: After adding those cards, you must discard 2 cards from your hand.

### **How to Use This Ability:**
1. **Winning a Trick**: First, you need to win a trick while playing as Bendt. This means you must play a card that is higher than the cards played by your opponents in that trick.
2. **Immediate Use**: Once you win the trick, you can immediately activate Bendt's ability. This is crucial because his ability does not carry over to the next round.
3. **Card Management**: After drawing 2 new cards, you will need to choose 2 cards from your hand to discard. This can be a strategic moment to get rid of cards that are less useful for your current strategy or to make space for potentially better cards.

### **Strategic Considerations**:
- **Hand Optimization**: Use Bendt's ability to improve your hand by drawing cards that can help you win future tricks or better align with your bidding strategy.
- **Discard Wisely**: Think carefully about which cards to discard. If you have cards that are unlikely to help you win tricks in the upcoming rounds, it’s a good time to let them go.
- **Timing**: Consider when to play Bendt. If you anticipate needing a stronger hand in the upcoming tricks, winning a trick with him at the right moment can be pivotal.

### **Example**:
Imagine you are in a round where you have a mix of high and low cards. You play Bendt and win the trick with a high card. You then draw 2 cards from the deck, perhaps getting a couple of strong cards that could help you in the next tricks. You might choose to discard a low card and a card that doesn’t fit your strategy, thus optimizing your hand for the next round.

By effectively using Bendt the Bandit's ability, you can enhance your chances of winning more tricks and scoring points, making him a valuable asset in your pirate crew!",0.99999999998,0.45454545454545453,0.9681348607506873

Here’s how it works:

### Game Rule Explanation:
When you play as the Rascal of Roatan, you can use your ability to bet either **0, 10, or 20 points** after you have won a trick with him. The key here is that you must declare your bet before the round begins, and it must be used immediately; it does not carry over to future rounds.

- **Betting Mechanics**:
  - **Bet 0 Points**: If you choose to bet 0, you are essentially saying you do not expect to win any tricks this round. If you win any tricks, you earn no points for your bet, but you still score based on your actual tricks won.
  - **Bet 10 Points**: If you bet 10 points, you will earn those points if you accurately predict the number of tricks you will win. If you miss your bid by 1, you earn nothing from the bet but still score based on your tricks won.
  - **Bet 20 Points**: Betting 20 points works the same way as betting 10 points, but the reward is higher. You must accurately predict your tricks to earn these points.

### Example:
Let’s say you decide to bet 10 points. If you predict you will win 3 tricks and you do indeed win exactly 3 tricks, you earn those 10 points in addition to the points from the tricks you won. However, if you only win 2 tricks, you miss your bid by 1 and earn nothing from the bet, but you still score points for the tricks you won.

### Contextual Strategy/Advice:
When playing as the Rascal of Roatan, consider your hand and the dynamics of the table before placing your bet. If you feel confident in your ability to win a specific number of tricks, betting 10 or 20 points can significantly boost your score. However, if your hand is weak or the competition is fierce, a bet of 0 might be a safer choice to avoid losing points.

Also, keep an eye on the other players' bids and their potential to win tricks. This can help you gauge whether your bet is realistic or if you might want to play it safe. 

Utilizing the Rascal's ability effectively can turn the tide in your favor, especially if you can read the game well and anticipate the outcomes of the tricks!",0.99999999998,0.5384615384615384,0.9634829414178844

There are three standard suits; Parrot (green), Treasure  \n![7_image_0.png](7_image_0.png) Chest (yellow), Treasure Map (purple), and the trump suit: Jolly Roger (Black). Jolly Roger cards outrank (trump) the other three suits.  \n8 If a suit card is played first in a trick (lead), all players must 'follow suit' and play that same suit (if they are going to play a numbered card). If you don't have the suit that was lead, you may play any other suit. If all cards played are the same suit, the highest numbered card would win the trick.

This means that after the cards have been dealt, but before the bidding or play begins, you can take a moment to examine the remaining cards in the deck that are not in play for that round. 

### Game Rule Explanation:
When you use Juanita Jade's ability, you will gain valuable information about which cards are not available for the current round. This can help you make more informed decisions regarding your bids and strategies for winning tricks. Remember, this ability must be used immediately after winning a trick with Juanita Jade, and it does not carry over to the next round.

### Contextual Strategy/Advice:
Using Juanita's ability effectively can significantly enhance your strategic play. For instance, if you notice that several high-value cards of a particular suit are not in play, you might decide to bid lower, knowing that your opponents may have fewer strong cards to play. Conversely, if you see that many trump cards are absent, you might feel more confident in leading with a high-numbered card of a non-trump suit.

### Example:
Imagine you win a trick with Juanita Jade and then use her ability to look at the cards not dealt. You discover that all the high-value Jolly Roger cards (the trump suit) are still in the deck. This knowledge could lead you to adjust your strategy, perhaps opting to play conservatively in the upcoming tricks, as you might anticipate that your opponents will have strong cards to play later on.

In summary, Juanita Jade's ability to see the cards not dealt can provide you with a strategic edge, allowing you to tailor your bidding and play based on the information you gather. Use it wisely!",0.99999999998,0.7777777777777778,0.9281882786902501

Specifically, he can choose to:

1. **Increase his bid by 1**: If he feels confident that he can win more tricks than he initially predicted, he can raise his bid to reflect that increased confidence.

2. **Decrease his bid by 1**: Conversely, if he feels uncertain about his hand or the potential tricks he can win, he can lower his bid to avoid overcommitting.

3. **Leave his bid the same**: If he believes his original bid accurately reflects his chances, he can choose not to change it at all.

This ability is particularly useful because it allows Harry to react to the dynamics of the game and the cards he has in hand. For example, if he initially bids 3 tricks but then sees a strong card played by another player that could potentially win a trick, he might decide to lower his bid to 2. Alternatively, if he has a strong hand and sees that other players are likely to underbid, he might increase his bid to 4.

### Example:
Imagine Harry initially bids 3 tricks. After seeing the cards played in the first few tricks, he realizes he has a strong chance of winning 4 tricks. He can then adjust his bid to 4. On the other hand, if he sees that his opponents are playing high-value cards and he feels his chances have diminished, he can reduce his bid to 2.

### Strategic Advice:
When using Harry's ability, consider the cards that have already been played and the bidding patterns of your opponents. Adjusting your bid can be a strategic move to either capitalize on a strong hand or mitigate the risk of overcommitting. Always keep in mind the potential for bonus points and how your bid aligns with your overall strategy for the round.",0.8874999999778125,0.8888888888888888,0.897367835354947

### Game Rule Explanation:
1. **Direct Hit**: If you bid exactly the number of cards you believe will be played in that round, you achieve a ""Direct Hit."" For a direct hit, you earn **all** of the potential points for that round.
   
2. **Glancing Blow**: If you are off by one card (either over or under your bid), this is considered a ""Glancing Blow,"" and you earn **half** of the potential points.

3. **Complete Miss**: If you miss your bid by two or more cards, you score **none** of the potential points.

### Bonus Points Calculation:
- The potential points for the round are determined by the number of cards dealt. For example, if 5 cards are dealt, the total potential points for that round would be 50 points (10 points per card).
- If you achieve a direct hit by bidding correctly, you would score the full 50 points. If you had a glancing blow, you would score 25 points (half of 50). If you completely missed, you would score 0 points.

### Example:
Let’s say in a round where 4 cards are dealt (40 potential points):
- If you bid 2 and hit exactly (Direct Hit), you score 40 points.
- If you bid 2 but were off by 1 (Glancing Blow), you would score 20 points.
- If you bid 2 and were off by 2 or more (Complete Miss), you score 0 points.

### Contextual Strategy/Advice:
When considering your bids, think carefully about the number of cards that have been played in previous rounds and how your opponents are bidding. If you notice a pattern, you might adjust your bids to either play conservatively or take calculated risks, depending on your current score and the game's state.

By keeping track of how many cards have been dealt and your opponents' tendencies, you can make more informed decisions on your bids, maximizing your chances for those coveted direct hits and bonus points!",0.99999999998,0.8571428571428571,0.8861453906494211

According to the rules, this results in earning **half** of the potential points for that round.

### Game Rule Explanation:
To clarify, the scoring system works as follows:
- **Direct Hit**: If you hit your bid exactly, you earn all of the potential points for that round.
- **Glancing Blow**: If you are off by one, you earn half of the potential points.
- **Complete Miss**: If you are off by two or more, you earn no points.

For example, if there are 4 cards dealt in a round (which gives a potential score of 40 points), and you bid 1 but actually win 2 tricks, you would be considered to have made a glancing blow. Therefore, you would earn half of the potential points, which would be 20 points for that round.

### Contextual Strategy/Advice:
When making your bids, consider how many tricks you realistically think you can win based on your hand and the current game dynamics. If you feel uncertain, sometimes it might be wise to bid conservatively to avoid a complete miss, especially if you suspect others may be overbidding. 

### Example:
Continuing with the previous example, if you bid 1 and won 2 tricks, you would score 20 points for that round due to the glancing blow. If you had instead bid 2 and won 2 tricks, you would have scored a direct hit and earned the full 40 points. Thus, being mindful of your hand and the bids of others can significantly impact your scoring strategy.

### Game Rule Explanation:
When you make a bid, you are predicting how many tricks you will win during that round. The scoring works as follows:

- **Direct Hit**: If you win exactly the number of tricks you bid, you earn points based on the tricks taken (20 points per trick).
- **Glancing Blow**: If you are off by 1 trick, you earn half of the potential points for that round.
- **Complete Miss**: If you are off by 2 or more tricks, you earn no points for that round.

For example, if you bid 3 tricks and end up winning 0 tricks, that’s a complete miss. If there were 5 cards dealt in that round, you would have had a potential score of 50 points (10 points per card). However, since you missed your bid by 3 tricks, you score **0 points** for that round.

### Contextual Strategy/Advice:
When considering your bid, think carefully about the cards in your hand and the dynamics of the game. If you feel uncertain about your ability to win the exact number of tricks you bid, it might be safer to either underbid or bid zero, especially if you believe the round will be competitive. Remember, bidding zero can be risky, but if you manage to take no tricks, it can yield a substantial score.

### Example:
Let’s say you bid 2 tricks but ended up winning 5 tricks. Since you were off by 3 tricks, you would receive no points for that round. This could significantly impact your overall score, especially if other players are scoring well. Always keep an eye on how many tricks others are taking and adjust your strategy accordingly to avoid complete misses.

This means that Harry predicted he would win no tricks, Shirley expected to win one trick, and Poe aimed to win two tricks. 

### Game Rule Explanation:
In **Skull King**, after the cards are dealt, players must assess their hands and decide how many tricks they believe they can win. The bids are revealed simultaneously after a countdown, and the players must be careful with their predictions, as scoring is based on how accurately they can predict their success. 

- If a player bids correctly (i.e., they win the exact number of tricks they bid), they score points based on the total potential points for that round, which is determined by the number of cards dealt.
- If they miss their bid by one trick, they score half the points. If they miss by more than one, they score no points.

### Contextual Strategy/Advice:
When making your bid, consider not only the strength of your hand but also the bids of your opponents. If you believe you have a strong hand but your opponents are bidding conservatively, it might be wise to bid slightly higher than your initial instinct. Conversely, if you sense that your hand is weak, a zero bid can be a strategic move, especially if you think others will overestimate their hands.

### Example:
In the scenario where Harry, Shirley, and Poe all bid and then played the round, if they each successfully matched their bids, they would each score the full points available for that round. This emphasizes the importance of making a well-informed bid based on your hand and the dynamics of the game.

- **Glancing Blow**: If you are off by 1 trick, you earn half of the potential points. For example, if you bid 3 and win 4 tricks, you would score 20 points.
- **Complete Miss**: If you are off by 2 or more tricks, you earn no points for that round.

### Contextual Strategy/Advice:
When bidding in this round, consider the number of cards dealt and your hand's strength. If you feel confident about winning a specific number of tricks, aim for a direct hit to maximize your score. However, if you're unsure, it might be safer to underbid slightly to avoid a complete miss, especially since the penalties for overbidding can be steep.

### Example:
If you bid 2 tricks and win 2, you would score the full 40 points. If you bid 3 and only win 2, you would score 20 points. If you bid 4 and win 2, you would score 0 points.

Let's break down how this score was achieved based on the rules and the context provided.

### Game Rule Explanation:
In Skull King, each round, players bid on the number of tricks they expect to win. The scoring for the round is based on how accurately they meet their bids:

1. **Direct Hit**: If a player meets their bid exactly, they earn all potential points for that round.
2. **Glancing Blow**: If a player is off by one trick, they earn half of the potential points.
3. **Complete Miss**: If a player is off by two or more tricks, they earn no points.

In the second round, **4 cards were dealt**, which means the total potential points for that round was **40 points** (10 points per card dealt).

### Harry's Performance:
- Harry bid **1** trick and successfully won **1 trick**. This means he achieved a **Direct Hit**.
- Since he hit his bid exactly, he earned the full potential points for that round, which is **40 points**.

### Summary:
So, to summarize, Harry scored **40 points** in the second round because he accurately predicted the number of tricks he would win, resulting in a Direct Hit and earning him all the potential points available for that round.

According to the context provided, in this round, 4 cards were dealt, giving a potential score of 40 points (10 points for each card).

Shirley made a bid of 0 tricks and ended up winning 1 trick. Here’s how her score was calculated:

1. **Bid and Result**: Shirley bid 0 and took 1 trick.
2. **Scoring for Bidding Zero**: When you bid zero, if you get your bid correct (which means winning 0 tricks), you score 10 points for each card dealt. However, if you bid zero and take 1 or more tricks, you lose points instead. The penalty for each trick taken when bidding zero is 10 points per card dealt.
3. **Calculation**: Since Shirley took 1 trick when she bid 0, she incurred a penalty of 10 points for each of the 4 cards dealt. Therefore, her score for the round would be:
   - **Penalty**: 10 points x 4 cards = -40 points.

So, Shirley's score in the second round was **-40 points** due to her incorrect bid of zero while winning 1 trick.

### Strategic Insight:
When considering a zero bid, it's crucial to assess your hand and the likelihood of winning tricks. If you feel confident that you can avoid winning any tricks, a zero bid can be rewarding. However, if there's any uncertainty, it might be safer to bid a small number of tricks to avoid the steep penalties associated with a zero bid gone wrong.

Each round consists of an increasing number of cards dealt to each player, starting with 1 card in the first round and culminating in 10 cards in the tenth round. This structure is designed to build tension and strategy as players must adapt their bidding and play style based on the number of cards they hold.

### Game Rule Explanation:
- **Dealing Cards**: At the beginning of each round, the entire deck is shuffled, including all cards played in previous rounds. This ensures that the game remains dynamic and unpredictable. 
- **Bidding**: Before each round begins, players must bid on the number of tricks they believe they will win. This is crucial because scoring is based on whether you meet your bid exactly. If you win the exact number of tricks you bid, you score points; if you miss your bid by even one trick, you lose points.

### Contextual Strategy/Advice:
As you progress through the rounds, consider how the increasing number of cards affects your bidding strategy. In the early rounds, with fewer cards, it may be easier to predict your success. However, as the rounds progress and you have more cards, the potential for both winning and losing tricks increases. Pay attention to the cards played by your opponents and adjust your bids accordingly. 

### Example:
For instance, if you are in round 5 and have 5 cards, you might feel confident in bidding 3 tricks if you have strong cards. However, if you notice that your opponents are playing aggressively, you might want to reconsider your bid to avoid losing points.

Remember, the key to success in Skull King lies in balancing your bids with the cards you hold and the actions of your opponents. Good luck, Captain!",0.94999999997625,0.45454545454545453,0.931348150350917

There are three standard suits; Parrot (green), Treasure  \n![7_image_0.png](7_image_0.png) Chest (yellow), Treasure Map (purple), and the trump suit: Jolly Roger (Black). Jolly Roger cards outrank (trump) the other three suits.  \n8 If a suit card is played first in a trick (lead), all players must 'follow suit' and play that same suit (if they are going to play a numbered card). If you don't have the suit that was lead, you may play any other suit. If all cards played are the same suit, the highest numbered card would win the trick. Cards without numbers are not suit cards and may be played regardless of what was led.  \nExample: Samuel plays a green 7, Bonny then lays down a green 12, and Henry plays a green 8. Bonny wins the trick.  \nWhen you play a different suit (non-trump) than the suit that's in play, your card will lose, even if it is the highest number played. Example: Scarlet plays a yellow 12 and Thomas plays a  \n![8_image_0.png](8_image_0.png) yellow 5. Jack doesn't have a yellow card and plays a purple 14.

Then, they play a card to lead the next trick. Play continues until all the tricks in that round have been played. Tally each player's score, including any bonus points earned, on the scorepad. The player to the dealer's left becomes the new dealer. This player shuffles all cards, including the ones played in the previous round, and then deals them, increasing the number of cards dealt by 1 from the previous round.

For instance, in Round 1, each player is dealt 1 card; in Round 2, each player gets 2 cards, and so on, up to Round 10, where each player will receive 10 cards.

This mechanic is crucial because it directly influences your bidding strategy. The more cards you have, the more tricks you might realistically be able to win, assuming you have a good mix of high-value cards and trump cards. 

### Example:
If you are in Round 5, each player will receive 5 cards. This means you should assess your hand carefully to determine how many tricks you can realistically bid for based on the strength of your cards. If you have several high cards in the trump suit (Jolly Roger), you might feel confident bidding higher, while a hand with mostly low cards might lead you to bid conservatively.

### Strategic Insight:
As you progress through the rounds, keep track of the cards that have been played and adjust your bidding accordingly. If you notice that many high cards have already been played, it might be wise to lower your bid in subsequent rounds, especially if you are dealt fewer high-value cards. Always consider how the number of cards dealt can affect your ability to win tricks and adjust your strategy based on your hand and the cards that have already been played.",0.99999999998,0.35,0.8080173089842897

So, if you bid 3 and won 2 tricks, the entry in the ""Bid and Result"" section would look like this: **3 / 2**.

### Game Rule Explanation:
The accuracy of your bid directly affects your scoring for the round. If you hit your bid exactly, you will score points based on the number of tricks you won. If you miss your bid, either by winning fewer or more tricks than you predicted, you will incur penalties. 

- **Direct Hit**: If your bid matches your actual tricks won, you earn 20 points for each trick.
- **Glancing Blow**: If you are off by 1 trick, you earn half of the potential points.
- **Complete Miss**: If you are off by 2 or more tricks, you earn no points for that round.

### Contextual Strategy/Advice:
When making your bid, consider not only your hand but also the tendencies of your opponents. If you feel confident in your hand, don't hesitate to bid higher, but be cautious of overestimating your abilities. Conversely, if you suspect your opponents may be strong, a conservative bid might be wise. 

### Example:
For instance, if you bid 0 tricks and successfully take none, you would score points based on the number of cards dealt that round. However, if you bid 0 and end up winning 1 or more tricks, you would incur a significant penalty. Always weigh the risk versus reward when deciding your bid!

Let’s break down how this works according to the scoresheet sections you've mentioned.

### Points Representation on the Scoresheet

1. **Bid and Result (D)**: This section is where you record the number of tricks you predicted to win (your bid) and the actual number of tricks you won during the round. For example, if you bid 3 and won 3 tricks, you would write ""3 | 3"" in this section.

2. **Bid Points (E)**: Here, you calculate the points based on your bidding accuracy:
   - If you win the exact number of tricks you bid, you earn **20 points for each trick**. So, if you bid 3 and won 3, you would write **60** points here (20 × 3).
   - If you win more or fewer tricks than you bid, you lose **10 points for each trick you were off**. For instance, if you bid 2 but won 4 tricks, you were off by 2 tricks, resulting in a loss of **20 points** (-10 × 2).

3. **Bonus (F)**: This section is for any additional bonus points you might earn during the round. However, remember that if your bid is incorrect, you won't score any bonus points.

4. **Round Points (G)**: This is the total for the round, calculated by adding your Bid Points and any Bonus points. If you earned 60 points from your bid and had no bonus points, you would write **60** here.

5. **Running Total (H)**: This keeps a cumulative score of your performance across rounds. You add the Round Points from the current round to your previous total to get your new Running Total.

6. **Bid Type (I)**: This indicates whether you used Canonball or Grapeshot scoring, which can affect how you approach your bidding strategy.

### Example of Scoring

Let’s say you are in Round 3, and you bid 2 tricks. You end up winning 1 trick. Here’s how you would fill out the scoresheet:

- **Bid and Result (D)**: ""2 | 1""
- **Bid Points (E)**: You were off by 1, so you lose 10 points. You would write **-10** here.
- **Bonus (F)**: If you earned no bonus points, you would write **0**.
- **Round Points (G)**: This would be **-10** (Bid Points + Bonus).
- **Running Total (H)**: If your previous total was 50, you would now write **40** (50 - 10).

### Strategic Insight

When bidding, consider not just how many tricks you think you can win, but also the potential for losing points if you're off. It can be beneficial to bid conservatively if you're unsure, as being off by too much can significantly impact your score. Always keep an eye on the cards played and the tendencies of your opponents, as this can inform your bidding strategy for subsequent rounds.

By carefully tracking your bids and results on the scoresheet, you can make informed decisions in future rounds, maximizing your scoring potential while minimizing losses.",0.99999999998,0.9642857142857143,0.8347770404971664

Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Bid Points**: This is determined by how accurately you predicted the number of tricks you would win. If you bid correctly (a ""Direct Hit""), you earn points based on the total potential points for that round. If you're off by one (a ""Glancing Blow""), you earn half of the potential points. If you're off by two or more (a ""Complete Miss""), you earn no points and may even lose points depending on the scoring method you're using.

2. **Bonus Points**: These are additional points you can earn based on specific conditions met during the round. For example, if you successfully win a certain type of trick or fulfill a special condition outlined in the game, you can add these bonus points to your total.

3. **Calculating Round Points**: To find your Round Points, simply add your Bid Points to your Bonus Points. 

   - **Example**: If you bid 2 tricks and won exactly 2 (a Direct Hit) in a round where 4 cards were dealt (40 potential points), you would earn 40 Bid Points. If you also earned 10 Bonus Points for a special condition, your Round Points would be 40 (Bid Points) + 10 (Bonus Points) = 50 Round Points.

4. **Running Total**: After calculating your Round Points, you will then add this to your previous total to keep a Running Total of your score throughout the game.

### Strategic Insight:
When making your bid, consider not only your hand but also the potential for bonus points. If you feel confident in your ability to win a specific number of tricks, aim for a Direct Hit to maximize your points. However, if you're uncertain, it might be safer to bid lower to avoid the penalties associated with missing your bid.

Here’s a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Complete the Current Round**: After you finish the round, determine your Round Points. This is calculated as follows:
   - If you're using the **Skull King's Scoring**: You earn points only if you bid correctly. If you bid exactly right, you earn points based on the number of cards dealt. If you're off by 1, you lose points. If you're off by 2 or more, you lose points as well.
   - If you're using the **Rascal's Scoring**: You earn points based on your accuracy relative to the total potential points for that round (10 points for each card dealt).

2. **Calculate Round Points**: Write down your Round Points in the scoresheet under ""Round Points"" (G).

3. **Update the Running Total**: To find your new Running Total (H), take the previous Running Total (from the last round) and add the current Round Points to it. 

   For example:
   - If your previous Running Total was 30 and you scored 20 points in the current round, your new Running Total would be 30 + 20 = 50.

This Running Total keeps track of your cumulative score throughout the game, allowing you to see how you’re performing over the rounds.

### Strategic Insight:
As you play, keep an eye on your Running Total. If you're trailing behind, you might want to take riskier bids in the next rounds to catch up, especially if you feel confident in your ability to predict your tricks accurately. Conversely, if you're leading, you might want to play conservatively to maintain your lead.

These bid types are part of the Rascal Scoring system, which adds a layer of strategy to your bidding process.

### Game Rule Explanation:
1. **Canonball**: This type of bid is typically used when you are confident in your ability to win a specific number of tricks. If you bid using Canonball, you are aiming to win exactly the number of tricks you declare. Scoring for Canonball follows the standard rules where you earn points based on the accuracy of your bid.

2. **Grapeshot**: This bid type is more flexible and can be used when you want to take a risk or when you feel uncertain about the exact number of tricks you can win. Grapeshot allows for a broader range of outcomes, and the scoring may differ based on how many tricks you actually win compared to your bid.

### Contextual Strategy/Advice:
When deciding between Canonball and Grapeshot, consider your hand and the current dynamics of the game. If you have a strong hand and feel confident, a Canonball bid might be the way to go. However, if you're unsure or if the other players seem to have strong cards, opting for a Grapeshot bid could allow you to mitigate potential losses while still aiming for a decent score.

### Example:
For instance, if you bid 3 tricks as a Canonball and successfully win 3 tricks, you would earn 60 points (20 points for each trick). Conversely, if you bid 3 tricks as a Grapeshot and only win 1 trick, you might still have a chance to score based on the flexibility of that bid type, depending on how the scoring is structured for Grapeshot in your game.

Understanding these bid types and when to use them can significantly impact your overall strategy and scoring potential in *Skull King*.",0.94999999997625,0.5789473684210527,0.8703784059643734

If you have more than four players participating in your game, you will need to use **two scoresheets** to keep track of everyone's scores. This allows you to maintain an organized record of bids, results, and points for all players involved.

### Game Rule Explanation:
When using two scoresheets, simply divide the players between the two sheets. For example, if you have six players, you could have three players on each scoresheet. Make sure to clearly label each player's name and keep track of their respective rounds and points separately on each sheet. 

### Contextual Strategy/Advice:
When playing with more than four players, it’s important to communicate clearly about who is on which scoresheet, especially during scoring at the end of each round. This will help avoid confusion and ensure that everyone’s scores are accurately recorded. Additionally, consider how the dynamics of having more players might affect your bidding strategy, as competition for tricks can become more intense.

### Example:
If you have a game with six players, you might have Player A, B, and C on Scoresheet 1, and Player D, E, and F on Scoresheet 2. After each round, you would tally the points for each player on their respective sheets, ensuring that everyone’s performance is tracked correctly.

Additionally, if you possess the black (Jolly Roger) 14 card, you earn **20 points** for that card. 

### Game Rule Explanation:
The scoring for the 14 cards is straightforward:
- **Standard Suits (Yellow, Purple, Green)**: Each 14 card in these suits contributes **10 points** to your score at the end of the round.
- **Trump Suit (Jolly Roger)**: This card is more valuable, granting you **20 points** if you have it.

### Example:
If you end the round with:
- 1 yellow 14 card: **10 points**
- 1 purple 14 card: **10 points**
- 1 green 14 card: **10 points**
- 1 black (Jolly Roger) 14 card: **20 points**

Your total score from these cards would be **10 + 10 + 10 + 20 = 50 points**.

### Contextual Strategy/Advice:
When considering your bids and play strategy, keep in mind the value of the 14 cards. If you have a chance to win tricks that could lead to acquiring these cards, it may be worth adjusting your bids accordingly. Additionally, if you notice opponents collecting these cards, you might want to play more aggressively to win tricks and prevent them from scoring high.

This is a significant bonus, as it rewards you for holding onto this powerful card until the end of the round.

### Game Rule Explanation:
To clarify, at the end of each round, players score points based on the cards they have collected. The Jolly Roger 14 card is one of the special cards in the game, and its point value is specifically outlined in the rules. In addition to the 20 points for the Jolly Roger, you also earn 10 points for each of the standard suit 14 cards (yellow, purple, or green) you possess.

### Contextual Strategy/Advice:
When playing, consider the value of holding onto the Jolly Roger card. If you can successfully keep it until the end of the round, it can significantly boost your score. However, be mindful of your opponents' bids and their potential to capture tricks that could include the Jolly Roger. If you suspect that other players are also aiming for high-value cards, it may be wise to play defensively or strategically to protect your lead.

### Example:
For instance, if you end the round with the Jolly Roger and two yellow 14 cards, your score from those cards would be:
- **20 points** for the Jolly Roger
- **20 points** (10 points each) for the two yellow 14 cards

This totals **40 points** just from those cards alone, showcasing the importance of strategic card management throughout the game.

### Game Rule Explanation:
- **14 Cards Scoring**: You earn **10 points** for each standard suit (yellow, purple, or green) 14 card you have, and **20 points** for the black (Jolly Roger) 14 card you hold. 
- **Opponent's 14 Cards**: Importantly, every 14 card that any player has at the end of the round contributes to your bonus points as well. This means if an opponent plays a 14 card, it counts towards your total bonus points at the end of the round, regardless of whether you played it or not.

### Contextual Strategy/Advice:
When considering your bids and strategy, keep in mind the potential impact of your opponents' 14 cards. If you notice that opponents are likely to win tricks with their 14 cards, you might want to adjust your bidding strategy accordingly. If you can predict their success, you can position yourself to benefit from the bonus points associated with those cards.

### Example:
For instance, if you have one yellow 14 card and your opponent has two purple 14 cards, at the end of the round, you would score **10 points** for your yellow 14 card and **20 points** for each of your opponent's purple 14 cards, totaling **50 points** from the 14 cards alone.

2. **Deferring Suit Setting**: If the next player also plays an Escape card, a Tigress as an Escape, or a Loot card, they defer the suit-setting responsibility to the next player. This can create a chain reaction where multiple players might play these types of cards, leading to a situation where the last player to play one of these cards gets to set the suit.

### Example:

### Strategic Insight:
When leading with an Escape or similar card, consider the implications of allowing the next player to set the suit. If you suspect they have a strong suit, it might be beneficial to play a card that allows you to control the trick instead.

Here’s how it works:

### Game Rule Explanation:
1. **Leading with a Special Card**: When you lead with a special card, the other players are not required to follow suit with a numbered card of the same suit. This means they can play any card they choose, including other special cards or cards from different suits.

2. **Effect on Following Players**: The suit that is in play is determined by the card you lead with. If you lead with a special card, the next players can play any card they want, regardless of the suit you played. This can create opportunities for strategic plays, as players can use their special cards to disrupt the expected flow of the game.

3. **Winning the Trick**: If a special card is played, the highest special card wins the trick unless a trump card (Jolly Roger) is played. If a trump card is played, it will win the trick regardless of the other cards played.

### Contextual Strategy/Advice:
Using special cards effectively can be a game-changer. Consider leading with a special card when you want to create confusion or when you suspect that your opponents are holding strong cards in a particular suit. This can force them to play their high-value cards early or waste them on tricks they cannot win.

### Example:
For instance, if you lead with the Skull King (a special card), the other players can play any card they wish. If they have a strong hand in a particular suit, they might choose to play a low card from that suit, knowing they can’t win the trick. This can help you gauge their hand strength and adjust your strategy accordingly.

In summary, leading with a special card opens up the game, allowing for more flexibility and strategic depth in how players respond. Use this to your advantage to control the flow of the game!",0.99999999998,0.7619047619047619,0.8500620926330357

These cards allow you to break the standard rules that govern the play of numbered cards. Specifically, you can choose to play a special card in any trick, regardless of the suit that was led. This flexibility can be a game-changer, especially when you're trying to win a trick or disrupt your opponents' plans.

### Function of Special Cards:
1. **Breaking Suit Rules**: Normally, players must follow suit if they can. However, special cards allow you to bypass this requirement. For instance, if a player leads with a yellow card and you have no yellow cards but hold a special card, you can still play that special card instead of being forced to play a card from another suit.

2. **Strategic Advantage**: Using special cards effectively can help you win crucial tricks that you might otherwise lose. For example, if you anticipate that a particular trick is vital for your bid, playing a special card can ensure you take that trick, even if you don't have the leading suit.

3. **Surprise Element**: The unpredictability of special cards can also create opportunities to catch your opponents off guard. They may assume you are unable to compete for a trick, only to find you playing a special card that changes the outcome.

### Example:
Imagine you are in a round where the leading player plays a high-numbered card from a suit you cannot follow. You hold a special card, such as the Skull King or a Pirate. By playing your special card, you can win the trick, potentially securing a critical point for your bid or disrupting your opponents' strategies.

### Strategic Advice:
When you have special cards in hand, consider the timing of when to play them. Holding onto them until a pivotal moment can maximize their impact. Additionally, keep track of which special cards have been played, as this knowledge can inform your decisions on when to deploy your own special cards for maximum effect.

In summary, special cards in *Skull King* are powerful tools that can significantly influence the outcome of tricks and the overall game. Use them wisely to enhance your chances of winning!",0.99999999998,0.6521739130434783,0.9827438547711232

This is one of the key advantages of special cards in **Skull King**. They allow you to break the standard rules of following suit, which can be a strategic game-changer.

### Game Rule Explanation:
When you lead a trick, you can choose to play either a suit card (a numbered card from one of the four suits) or a special card. If you play a special card, it overrides the usual requirement to follow suit. This means that even if a suit card has been led, you can play a special card regardless of whether you have cards in the led suit or not.

For example, if a player leads with a green 7, and you have no green cards but do have a special card, you can play that special card instead of being forced to play a card from another suit. This flexibility can be crucial in winning tricks when you might otherwise be at a disadvantage.

### Contextual Strategy/Advice:
Using special cards wisely can significantly impact your success in the game. Consider saving your special cards for critical moments when you anticipate needing to win a trick that you might otherwise lose. If you know that a high-value suit card is likely to be played, deploying a special card can help you secure that trick.

### Example:
Imagine you are in a round where the first player leads with a yellow 10. You have no yellow cards but hold a special card. By playing the special card, you can take control of the trick, regardless of the other players' cards. This can also set you up for future tricks, as winning this one may give you an advantage in the overall round.

1. **Playing Special Cards**: You can play a special card in any trick, regardless of the suit that is currently being led. This means that if you have a special card in hand, you are not bound by the usual requirement to follow suit. 

2. **Leading with Special Cards**: When you lead a trick, you have the option to play either a suit card or a special card. If you choose to lead with a special card, it changes the dynamics of that trick, as the rules for the suit in play are altered.

3. **Timing of Use**: There are no specific limitations on when you can use a special card during a trick, as long as you are following the general rules of play. However, remember that once a special card is played, it cannot be used again in that round.

### Contextual Strategy/Advice:
Using special cards strategically can turn the tide of a round. Consider the timing of when to play them. For instance, if you suspect that your opponents are about to win a trick, playing a special card can disrupt their plans. Additionally, if you have a special card that allows you to change the lead, it can be beneficial to use it when you want to control the flow of the game.

### Example:
Imagine you are in a situation where you have a special card that allows you to change the lead. If your opponent leads with a strong suit card, you could play your special card to take control of the trick, potentially allowing you to play a card that helps you win the trick or avoid losing points.

Additionally, if you and your friends enjoy customizing games, creating unique cards can add a fresh twist to your sessions.

### Example:
For instance, if you decide to create a custom card that allows a player to skip their turn once per game, this could introduce a new strategic layer.

This setup allows for a varied experience as you navigate through different hand sizes, which can affect your bidding strategy and gameplay. 

### Game Rule Explanation:
Each round begins with dealing the specified number of cards to each player, and the entire deck, including cards played in previous rounds, is shuffled before dealing. This means that the dynamics of each round can change significantly based on the cards you and your opponents have.

### Contextual Strategy/Advice:
As you progress through the rounds, pay close attention to the cards that have been played and the bids made by your opponents. This will help you gauge the strength of your hand relative to theirs. In rounds with fewer cards, you might want to be more conservative with your bids, while in rounds with more cards, you can afford to be more aggressive if you feel confident in your hand.

### Example:
For instance, if you are in Round 4 and have a strong hand with high-value cards, you might consider bidding higher to capitalize on your advantage. Conversely, if you have a weak hand, it may be wise to bid lower to avoid penalties for missing your bid.

Remember to record your bids and results accurately on the scoresheet, as this will help you track your performance throughout the game and adjust your strategy in subsequent rounds. Enjoy your voyage in Skull King!",0.99999999998,0.9411764705882353,0.9077354921898279

- **Round 4**: 9 cards

This setup allows for a gradual increase in the number of cards dealt, which can significantly affect your bidding strategy and the dynamics of play as the rounds progress.

### Game Rule Explanation:
During each round, players will bid on the number of tricks they expect to win based on the strength of their hands. As you receive more cards in the later rounds, you'll have more information to make informed bids. Remember, the entire deck is shuffled at the start of each round, so previous rounds' cards do not influence the current round's play.

### Contextual Strategy/Advice:
As you approach the later rounds, particularly with 9 and 10 cards in hand, consider the overall strength of your hand and the potential for winning tricks. Pay attention to the cards that have already been played, as this can give you insight into what your opponents might still hold. Adjust your bids accordingly; if you feel confident in your hand, don't hesitate to bid high, but if you're uncertain, a conservative bid might be wiser.

### Example:
For instance, if you have a strong combination of high-value cards in Round 5, you might feel inclined to bid 8 or 9 tricks. However, if you notice that several high cards have already been played, you might want to reconsider and lower your bid to avoid penalties for overbidding.

This setup allows for a consistent and intense gameplay experience, as every player will have the same number of cards to strategize with throughout the game.

### Game Rule Explanation:
1. **Rounds**: You will play **10 rounds** in total.
2. **Cards Dealt**: In each round, the number of cards dealt corresponds to the round number. So, in round 1, each player gets 1 card, in round 2, 2 cards, and so forth, culminating in round 10 where each player receives 10 cards.

### Contextual Strategy/Advice:
With the **Broadside Barrage** setup, you can expect a lot of action and opportunities to score points. Since you will have a full hand of cards in the last round, it’s crucial to keep track of the cards that have been played and to adjust your bidding strategy accordingly. Pay attention to the bids of your opponents and try to anticipate their moves based on the cards they have already played.

### Example:
For instance, if you are in round 5, you will be dealt 5 cards. If you bid to win 3 tricks and manage to win exactly 3, you will score points based on the total number of cards dealt that round (which is 50 points if you are using the standard scoring method). If you miss your bid by 1, you would earn half of that potential score.

- **Round 4**: Each player is dealt **3 cards**.
- **Round 5**: Each player is dealt **1 card**.

This setup allows for a dynamic game where players must adapt their strategies as the number of cards decreases each round. 

### Game Rule Explanation:
In Skull King, players bid on the number of tricks they believe they can win each round. The unique aspect of the ""Whirlpool"" configuration is that as the rounds progress, the number of cards dealt decreases, which can significantly affect your ability to predict and win tricks. 

### Contextual Strategy/Advice:
As you approach each round, consider how the decreasing number of cards will impact your hand strength and your bidding strategy. For example, in the first round with 9 cards, you might have a stronger hand and feel confident in making a higher bid. However, by the final round with only 1 card, you’ll need to be very strategic about your bid, as you’ll have limited options.

### Example:
If you start with a strong hand in Round 1, you might bid high, anticipating that you can win several tricks. However, as you move to Round 5, where you only have 1 card, you should carefully assess the card you hold and the bids of your opponents. If you have a low-value card, it may be wise to bid zero tricks, as winning with just one card can be quite challenging.

Make sure to keep track of your bids and the cards played in previous rounds, as this will help you gauge the likelihood of winning tricks in subsequent rounds. Good luck on your voyage!",0.99999999998,0.7272727272727273,0.9425095260067287

This unique setup is a fun and quick variation of the game, perfect for a light-hearted session or when you're short on time.

### Game Rule Explanation:
- **Rounds**: You will only play a single round.
- **Cards Dealt**: Each player receives just one card. This means that the bidding and play will be based on a very limited hand, making the round quite different from the standard gameplay where players receive more cards over multiple rounds.

### Contextual Strategy/Advice:
With only one card in hand, your strategy will revolve around making the most of that single card. Consider the following:
- **Bidding Wisely**: Since you can only win one trick, think carefully about your card's strength. If you have a high-value card, you might confidently bid 1 trick. If your card is low, you might consider bidding zero.
- **Reading Opponents**: Pay attention to how your opponents bid. Their bids can give you clues about the strength of their cards, which can help you decide whether to play aggressively or conservatively.

### Example:
If you receive a Skull King card, you might want to bid 1, as it is likely to win a trick. Conversely, if you draw a low card, you might choose to bid zero, hoping to avoid winning any tricks and thus not incurring penalties.

Here’s how to effectively manage this aspect:

### Game Rule Explanation:
1. **Recording Cards Dealt**: At the beginning of each round, you will deal a number of cards equal to the round number. For example, in Round 1, each player receives 1 card; in Round 2, each player receives 2 cards, and so forth, up to Round 10 where each player receives 10 cards.
   
2. **Using the Scoresheet**: On the scoresheet, there are ovals designated for each round. As you deal the cards, make sure to record the number of cards dealt in the corresponding oval for that round. This helps everyone keep track of how many cards have been dealt and ensures that the game flows smoothly.

3. **Adjusting for More Players**: If you are playing with more than six players, remember to repeat the number of cards dealt in the final rounds to ensure each player has the same number of cards. This should also be noted on the scoresheet.

### Contextual Strategy/Advice:
- **Stay Organized**: Keeping accurate records on the scoresheet not only helps with tracking the game but also aids in strategizing your bids for each round. Knowing how many cards are in play can influence your predictions on how many tricks you can realistically win.

- **Plan Ahead**: As you record the number of cards dealt, think about how the increasing number of cards might affect your strategy. More cards can lead to more complex interactions, so consider how you can leverage your hand effectively.

### Example:
For instance, if you are in Round 3, you would deal 3 cards to each player. Make sure to mark this in the oval for Round 3 on the scoresheet. If you notice that you have dealt 3 cards, you can then anticipate that players will have more options for their bids and play, which may affect your own strategy for that round.

By following these steps and keeping your scoresheet updated, you’ll ensure a smooth and enjoyable game of Skull King!",0.99999999998,0.8260869565217391,0.9480476889859197

2. **Playing Cards in Order**: Following the lead, players take turns playing one card each in clockwise order. Each player must follow the suit of the card that was led if they have a card of that suit. If they do not have a card of the led suit, they may play any card from their hand.

3. **Winning the Trick**: The player who plays the highest-ranking card of the led suit wins the trick. If a special card like a Skull King or a Tigress is played, it can change the dynamics of who wins the trick based on the specific rules for those cards. The winner of the trick collects the cards and places them in a stack in front of them.

4. **Leading Subsequent Tricks**: The player who wins the trick then leads the next trick by playing a card from their hand. This continues until all tricks for that round have been played.

5. **End of the Round**: Once all tricks have been played, players tally their scores based on the number of tricks they won compared to their bids, including any bonus points earned.

### Example:
If Player A leads with a 5 of Hearts, Player B has a 7 of Hearts, Player C has a Skull King, and Player D has no Hearts and plays a 2 of Spades, Player B would win the trick with their 7 of Hearts. Player B would then lead the next trick.

### Strategy Tip:
As you play your cards, consider not only the cards you have but also what your opponents might be holding based on their bids and previous plays. Keeping track of which high cards have been played can give you an edge in predicting the outcome of future tricks.

Here’s how it works step-by-step:

1. **Leading the Trick**: The player to the left of the dealer starts the first trick by playing a card face-up in the center of the table. This card establishes the ""lead"" for that trick.

2. **Following Suit**: Each subsequent player, in clockwise order, must play a card of the same suit if they have one. If they do not have a card of the leading suit, they can play any card from their hand, including cards from the trump suit (the black-bordered Jolly Roger cards) or any other suit.

3. **Determining the Winner**: After all players have played a card, the player who played the highest-ranking card of the leading suit wins the trick. If any trump cards were played, the highest trump card wins the trick regardless of the leading suit. 

   - For example, if the leading card is a Green 10 and another player plays a Jolly Roger (trump card), the Jolly Roger wins the trick, even if the other players played higher cards in the leading suit.

4. **Collecting the Trick**: The winner of the trick collects all the cards played in that trick and places them in a stack in front of them. This player then leads the next trick by playing another card from their hand.

### Strategic Insight:
When deciding which card to play, consider not only the value of your cards but also the potential suits your opponents might have. If you have a strong trump card, it can be advantageous to hold onto it until you can use it to win a crucial trick. Additionally, if you are leading a trick, think about the cards you want to force your opponents to play; leading with a mid-range card can sometimes bait out higher cards from others, allowing you to win with a lower card later.

### Example:
Imagine you lead with a Blue 7. If your opponents play a Blue 5 and a Green 10, and you have a Jolly Roger, you can play it to ensure you win the trick, regardless of the leading suit. This strategy can help you secure tricks that are critical for meeting your bid.

As you play, keep in mind that winning tricks is not just about the cards you have but also about how well you can predict and influence the flow of the game. Pay attention to what cards have been played and consider how many tricks you need to win based on your bid. If you find yourself winning more tricks than you bid, you may want to adjust your strategy in future rounds to avoid losing points.

Here’s how it works step-by-step:

1. **Winning the Trick**: The player who played the highest-ranking card in the previous trick collects all the cards played in that trick and places them in a stack in front of them.

2. **Leading the Next Trick**: The player who won the trick now has the opportunity to lead the next trick. They can choose any card from their hand to play face up. This card sets the suit for the next trick, which means that other players must follow suit if they have cards of that suit.

3. **Choosing the Card**: The player can choose to play either a suit card (numbered cards) or a special card. If they lead with a special card, it may alter the rules for that trick, depending on the specific special card played.

4. **Continuing Play**: After the leading player plays their card, the other players will follow in clockwise order, playing one card each until all players have played a card for that trick.

### Example:
Let’s say you just won a trick by playing a 12 of Parrots, and you have the following cards left: 1 Jolly Roger, 5 of Sharks, and 8 of Parrots. You decide to lead the next trick with the Jolly Roger. Since the Jolly Roger is a trump card, it will win against any suit card played by your opponents, unless they also play a Jolly Roger.

### Strategic Advice:
When leading a trick, consider the cards you have left and the potential cards your opponents might play. If you have a strong card, leading with it can help you secure another trick. However, if you suspect your opponents might have higher cards in the same suit, it might be wise to lead with a special card to change the dynamics of the trick.

Remember, the choice of card can significantly influence the outcome of the round, so think carefully about your strategy as you lead each trick!",0.99999999998,0.6086956521739131,0.9550278799936219

   - If a player wins the exact number of tricks they bid, they earn **20 points** for each trick taken.
   - If they win more or fewer tricks than they bid, they lose **10 points** for each trick they were off. For example, if a player bids 3 tricks but wins only 1, they would lose 20 points.

2. **Record Bonus Points**: If there are any bonus points earned during the round (for example, capturing the Skull King or certain combinations of cards), these should also be added to the score.

3. **Calculate Round Points**: The total points for the round are calculated by adding the bid points and any bonus points. This total is then recorded on the scoresheet under ""Round Points.""

4. **Update Running Total**: After calculating the round points, update the running total, which is the cumulative score across all rounds played so far.

5. **Prepare for the Next Round**: The player to the dealer's left becomes the new dealer. They will shuffle all the cards, including those played in the previous round, and deal cards for the next round. The number of cards dealt will increase by one from the previous round (e.g., if 3 cards were dealt in round 3, then 4 cards will be dealt in round 4).

6. **Continue Playing**: The game continues in this manner until all 10 rounds have been completed. After the final round, the player with the highest score is declared the winner and becomes the pirate captain!

### Example:
If you bid 2 tricks and successfully win 2 tricks, you would score 40 points (20 points per trick). If you bid 3 tricks but only won 1, you would lose 20 points (10 points for each trick you were off). 

### Strategic Insight:
As you approach the end of a round, consider how your current score and the scores of your opponents might influence your bidding strategy in the next round. If you are behind, you might want to take more risks in your bids, while if you are ahead, you might play conservatively to maintain your lead.

1. **End of Round**: Once all tricks have been played, players tally their scores based on their bids and any bonus points earned.
2. **Choosing the New Dealer**: The player to the left of the current dealer takes on the role of the new dealer. This continues in a clockwise direction around the table.

As you prepare for the next round, consider how the change in dealer might affect your strategy. The new dealer has the opportunity to set the tone for the round with their card play. Pay attention to their bidding patterns and card choices, as this can give you insight into their strategy and help you adjust your own.

### Example:
If the previous dealer was particularly aggressive in their bidding and won many tricks, the new dealer might adopt a more conservative approach, which could influence how you bid and play your cards.

Here’s how it works:

1. **Shuffling the Deck**: At the start of each new round, the player who is now the dealer (the player to the left of the previous dealer) will shuffle the entire deck. This includes all cards that were played in the previous round, ensuring that the game remains dynamic and unpredictable.

2. **Dealing Cards**: The number of cards dealt increases by one card each round. Here’s the breakdown:
   - In **Round 1**, each player receives **1 card**.
   - In **Round 2**, each player receives **2 cards**.
   - This pattern continues until **Round 10**, where each player receives **10 cards**.

3. **Player Count Consideration**: If you are playing with more than six players, you will still follow the same rule of increasing the number of cards dealt by one each round. However, to ensure that all players have the same number of cards in the final rounds, you will repeat the number of cards dealt in the last round for the remaining rounds. For example, if you reach Round 10 with eight players, you would deal 10 cards to each player.

### Example:
If you are in Round 3, each player will receive **3 cards**. After all players have their cards, you will proceed to the bidding phase, where players will predict how many tricks they will win based on their hands.

### Strategic Insight:
As you prepare for the next round, consider the cards you have seen played in previous rounds. This knowledge can help you gauge the strength of your hand and make a more informed bid. Remember, the higher the card's value, the more likely you are to win a trick, so keep an eye on the trump cards (the black-bordered Jolly Roger cards) as they can significantly influence the outcome of tricks.

### Game Rule Explanation:
After each round, all cards played are shuffled back into the deck, and the dealer will deal one more card than in the previous round. This means that the game builds in complexity and strategy as players have more cards to manage and more tricks to win.

### Contextual Strategy/Advice:
As you progress through the rounds, consider how the increasing number of cards affects your bidding strategy. With more cards, you have a greater chance to win tricks, but also a higher risk if you misjudge your hand. Pay attention to the cards that have been played and the bids of your opponents, as this can inform your decisions in subsequent rounds.

### Example:
For instance, if you are in Round 4 and each player has 4 cards, you might want to bid conservatively if you have a weak hand. However, if you have a strong hand with high cards or trump cards, you might feel more confident in bidding higher. Just remember, if you bid zero and take any tricks, you will incur penalties, so weigh your options carefully!

Here’s what happens step-by-step:

1. **Final Score Tally**: All players will tally their scores from each round. This includes calculating the total points earned from bids and any bonus points accumulated throughout the game. 

2. **Determine the Winner**: The player with the highest total score after all ten rounds is declared the winner. This player is appointed as the ""pirate captain of the seven seas,"" which is a fun thematic element of the game.

3. **Scoring Breakdown**: Make sure to review the scoresheet for each player:
   - **Bid and Result**: Check how many tricks each player predicted to win versus how many they actually won.
   - **Bid Points**: Calculate the points earned or lost based on their bidding accuracy.
   - **Bonus Points**: Include any bonus points earned from special cards, such as the 14 cards, which can significantly impact the final score.

4. **Celebration of Victory**: The winning player can enjoy their victory and perhaps engage in some light-hearted banter with the other players about their pirate prowess!

### Strategic Insight:
As you approach the final rounds, keep in mind how your bidding strategies have played out. If you’ve been consistently overestimating or underestimating your bids, consider adjusting your approach in the last round to maximize your score. Also, remember to account for any 14 cards you might have, as they can provide substantial bonus points.

### Example:
For instance, if you have a total of 30 points from your bids and earned an additional 20 points from bonus cards, your final score would be 50 points. If another player has 45 points from bids and 10 from bonuses, they would finish with 55 points, making them the winner.

Here’s how it works:

1. **Scoring Each Round**: At the end of each round, players will calculate their scores based on their bids and the number of tricks they actually won. The scoresheet has specific sections for this:
   - **Bid and Result (D)**: Here, you record the number of tricks you predicted to win and the actual number you won.
   - **Bid Points (E)**: Points are awarded or deducted based on your accuracy in bidding. If you hit your bid exactly (Direct Hit), you earn all potential points for that round. If you are off by one (Glancing Blow), you earn half. If you miss by two or more (Complete Miss), you earn none.
   - **Bonus Points (F)**: Any additional points earned during the round are added here. Remember, if your bid is incorrect, you won’t score any bonus points.
   - **Round Points (G)**: This is the total score for the round, calculated by adding your Bid Points and Bonus Points.
   - **Running Total (H)**: This keeps a cumulative score throughout the game, adding the current round's points to the previous total.

2. **Final Tally**: After the tenth round, you will sum up the Running Total for each player. The player with the highest score at the end of these ten rounds is declared the winner and becomes the pirate captain!

### Example:
Let’s say in Round 5, you bid to win 3 tricks and actually won 3 tricks. You would earn the full potential points for that round (which is 50 points if 5 cards were dealt). If you had bid 3 but only won 2 tricks, you would earn half of the potential points (25 points). If you bid 3 and won 0 tricks, you would earn no points for that round.

### Strategic Insight:
As you approach the final rounds, consider how your bidding strategy has affected your scores. If you’ve been consistently overestimating your bids, it might be wise to adjust your strategy to be more conservative in your predictions. Conversely, if you’ve been underestimating, you might want to take a riskier approach in the final rounds to catch up.

Keep track of your opponents' bidding patterns as well; this can give you insight into their strategies and help you make more informed decisions in your own bidding. Good luck, and may you sail to victory as the pirate captain!",0.99999999998,1.0,0.862290505843127

Each round, players will receive an increasing number of cards, starting with 1 card in the first round and culminating with 10 cards in the tenth round. This progressive dealing adds an exciting layer to the game as players must adapt their strategies based on the number of cards they hold.

### Game Rule Explanation:
- **Round Structure**: 
  - **Round 1**: Each player is dealt **1 card**.
  - **Round 2**: Each player is dealt **2 cards**.
  - ...
  - **Round 10**: Each player is dealt **10 cards**.
  
At the beginning of each round, the entire deck, including all cards played in the previous rounds, is shuffled. This ensures that the game remains dynamic and unpredictable.

### Contextual Strategy/Advice:
As you progress through the rounds, consider how the increasing number of cards affects your bidding strategy. In the earlier rounds, with fewer cards, you might want to be conservative with your bids, as the limited options can make it harder to predict outcomes. However, as the rounds progress and you have more cards, you can afford to be bolder in your bids, especially if you have a strong hand.

### Example:
For instance, in Round 5, when you receive 5 cards, you might have a better chance of winning more tricks compared to Round 1. If you feel confident in your hand, you could bid higher, but be cautious of your opponents' potential to outbid you or play strategically to win tricks.

Remember, the key to success in Skull King lies in accurately predicting the number of tricks you can win while also keeping an eye on your opponents' bids and playing styles. Good luck, Captain!",0.94999999997625,0.4166666666666667,0.9380384023506001

### Contextual Strategy/Advice:
As you begin with just one card, consider how you want to approach your bidding. Since you have limited information with only one card, think about the strength of your card and how it might fit into your overall strategy for the round. If you have a high card or a trump card (the black bordered Jolly Roger cards), you might want to bid higher, anticipating that you can win tricks. Conversely, if your card is low, you might consider a lower bid or even a bid of zero, aiming to avoid taking tricks if you feel you cannot win.

### Example:
For instance, if you are dealt a **Jolly Roger** card in the first round, you might feel confident in bidding high, as this card will likely win any trick it is played in. However, if you receive a low numbered card, you might decide to bid zero, hoping to avoid winning any tricks and thus not risking points.

### Contextual Strategy/Advice:
As you approach the final round with 10 cards, consider how your bidding strategy may need to adapt. With a larger hand, you have more options for both winning tricks and accurately predicting your bids. Think about the cards you have seen played in previous rounds and how they might influence your ability to meet your bid. 

### Example:
For instance, if you have a strong hand with several high-ranking cards, you might feel confident bidding high. Conversely, if you have a mix of low cards and a few high ones, you may want to be more conservative in your bidding to avoid overcommitting.

This means that every card, whether it was won in tricks or discarded, is mixed back into the deck before dealing begins for the new round. 

### Game Rule Explanation:
1. **Shuffling the Deck**: After the scoring for the previous round is tallied, the player to the left of the dealer becomes the new dealer. This player will gather all the cards from the previous round, including the tricks won by each player, and shuffle them together with the remaining cards in the deck.
   
2. **Dealing Cards**: The dealer then deals cards according to the round number. For example, in the first round, each player receives 1 card; in the second round, each player gets 2 cards, and so on, up to 10 cards in the tenth round.

### Contextual Strategy/Advice:
Since the deck is reshuffled each round, it’s important to keep track of the cards that have been played, especially the trump cards (the black-bordered Jolly Roger cards) and high-value cards. This knowledge can help you gauge the strength of your hand in the upcoming round. 

### Example:
For instance, if you notice that many high-value cards have already been played in previous rounds, you might adjust your bidding strategy accordingly, as the likelihood of drawing high cards in the next round decreases. Conversely, if you see that many low cards have been played, you might feel more confident in your hand for the next round.

By understanding this mechanic, you can better anticipate the flow of the game and make more informed decisions during your bidding and play.",0.99999999998,0.47619047619047616,0.9071748281544579

To achieve this, you will need to repeat the number of cards dealt in the earlier rounds for the remaining rounds. 

### Game Rule Explanation:
In **Skull King**, the game is structured to deal an increasing number of cards over ten rounds, starting with 1 card in the first round and culminating in 10 cards in the tenth round. However, when you have more than six players, you cannot deal 7, 8, or 9 cards in the final rounds without leaving some players with fewer cards than others. Instead, you simply repeat the number of cards dealt in the last round where all players received cards equally.

For example, if you have 8 players:
- In Round 1, deal 1 card to each player.
- In Round 2, deal 2 cards to each player.
- Continue this pattern up to Round 6, where each player will receive 6 cards.
- From Round 7 onward, instead of dealing 7 cards, you would deal 6 cards again to each player.
- This continues until the end of the game, ensuring that all players have the same number of cards in the final rounds.

### Contextual Strategy/Advice:
When adjusting the number of cards dealt in the later rounds, consider how this might affect your bidding strategy. With fewer cards, you may want to be more conservative in your bids, especially if you are unsure of your hand strength. Pay attention to the cards that have been played in previous rounds, as this can give you insight into what might still be in play.

### Example:
If you are in Round 7 with 8 players and you decide to deal 6 cards to each player, remember that this means you will not be able to bid as aggressively as you might have in earlier rounds where you had more cards. Adjust your expectations accordingly, and keep track of the cards that have been played to better inform your bids in the upcoming rounds.

By following this approach, you can maintain balance and fairness in the game, ensuring that all players have an equal opportunity to compete effectively in the final rounds. Enjoy your pirate adventure!",0.99999999998,1.0,0.8788464027680103

### Game Rule Explanation:
In the standard game, **Skull King** is played over 10 rounds, with the number of cards dealt increasing from 1 card in the first round to 10 cards in the tenth round. However, the rules allow for variations in both the number of rounds and the number of cards dealt per round. 

You can find suggested formats for modifying the game in the ""Variable Card Counts"" section of the rules. Here are a few examples of how you can adjust the game:

- **Even Keeled**: Play two rounds each of 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 cards per hand.
- **Skip to the Brawl**: Play one round each of 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 cards per hand.
- **Broadside Barrage**: Play ten rounds of 10 cards per hand.

### Contextual Strategy/Advice:
When modifying the game, consider the skill level and preferences of your players. For example, if your group enjoys a longer game with more strategy, you might opt for the **Broadside Barrage** format. Conversely, if you're looking for a quick and fun session, the **Past Your Bedtime** option, with just one card per hand, could lead to a light-hearted experience.

### Example:
If you decide to play the **Whirlpool** format, where you deal 9, 7, 5, 3, and 1 cards over two rounds each, you’ll need to adjust your bidding strategy accordingly. Players will have to adapt to the changing number of cards, which can significantly impact how they predict the number of tricks they can win.

### Game Rule Explanation:
For instance, if you are playing in round 5 and you bid zero, the potential score would be:
- **10 points x 5 cards = 50 points**.

If you successfully take zero tricks, you earn those 50 points. However, if you bid zero and end up taking one or more tricks, you will incur a penalty of **10 points for each card dealt that round**. So, in the same example, if you took 2 tricks in round 5 after bidding zero, you would lose **20 points** (10 points x 2 cards), resulting in a score of **-20 points** for that round.

### Contextual Strategy/Advice:
Bidding zero can be a high-risk, high-reward strategy. It’s essential to assess your hand and the likelihood of winning tricks before making this bid. If you feel confident that you can avoid winning any tricks, a zero bid can significantly boost your score. However, if you suspect that your opponents may play aggressively or if your hand has strong cards, it might be wiser to bid a small number instead.

### Example:
To illustrate, let’s say you are in round 7 and you bid zero. If you manage to take no tricks, you would score **70 points** (10 x 7). But if you mistakenly take 3 tricks, you would lose **30 points** (10 x 3), resulting in a score of **-30 points** for that round.

Here’s how it works:

### Game Rule Explanation:
If you bid zero and successfully take **one or more tricks**, you will incur a penalty of **10 points for each card dealt that round**. This means that your score will decrease significantly based on the number of cards dealt in that round. For instance, if you are playing in round 5 and you bid zero but end up taking 2 tricks, you will lose **50 points** (10 points x 5 cards dealt). 

### Example:
Let’s say you are in round 9, where 9 cards are dealt. If you bid zero and manage to take 3 tricks, your score for that round would be calculated as follows:
- **Penalty for taking tricks**: 10 points x 9 cards = -90 points.
So, you would score **-90 points** for that round.

### Contextual Strategy/Advice:
Bidding zero can be a high-risk, high-reward strategy. It’s crucial to assess your hand and the likelihood of winning tricks before making this bid. If you feel confident that you can avoid taking tricks, a zero bid can yield a substantial score if you succeed. However, if you misjudge the situation and end up taking tricks, the penalty can be quite damaging to your overall score. 

In general, consider the dynamics of the game and the tendencies of your opponents when deciding whether to bid zero. If you suspect that others may also be bidding low or if you have a strong hand, it might be wiser to bid a number that reflects your expected performance to avoid the harsh penalties associated with a zero bid.

With the Skull King's scoring, you only earn points for the round when you bid correctly. If you're off, even by 1, you'll lose points instead.""]","In *Skull King*, zero bids are considered risky primarily due to the potential for significant point loss if your expectations are not met. When you bid zero, you are essentially stating that you believe you will take no tricks during that round. If you manage to achieve this, the reward is substantial: you earn 10 points for each card dealt that round. For instance, if you bid zero in a round where 7 cards are dealt and you take no tricks, you would score 70 points (10 x 7).

However, the risk comes into play if you take even one trick. In that case, you will lose 10 points for each card dealt that round. So, if you bid zero in a round with 9 cards and end up capturing 2 tricks, you would lose 90 points (-10 x 9), which can severely impact your overall score.

### Key Mechanics:
1. **Correct Zero Bid**: If you bid zero and take zero tricks, you score points based on the number of cards dealt.
2. **Incorrect Zero Bid**: If you bid zero and take one or more tricks, you incur a penalty of 10 points for each card dealt.

### Strategic Considerations:
When deciding whether to bid zero, consider the following:
- **Your Hand**: Assess the strength of your cards. If you have high cards, you might inadvertently win tricks.
- **Opponent Behavior**: Pay attention to how your opponents are bidding and playing. If they are aggressive, it might be harder to avoid taking tricks.
- **Round Context**: The number of cards dealt in that round can influence your decision. Higher card counts mean a greater potential reward, but also a larger penalty if you miscalculate.

### Example:
Imagine you are in the 9th round, and you decide to bid zero. If you take 2 tricks, you would lose 90 points, which could be devastating. Conversely, if you take no tricks, you would gain 90 points. This high-stakes nature of zero bids is what makes them both thrilling and perilous.

In summary, while zero bids can lead to high rewards, they also carry the risk of significant penalties, making them a gamble that requires careful consideration of your hand and the dynamics of the game.",0.99999999998,0.8,0.8798077738113004

Let’s break down how scoring works in this scenario.

### Game Rule Explanation

When you bid zero, your goal is to take **no tricks** during that round. If you successfully take zero tricks, you score **10 points for each card dealt that round**. For example, if you are playing in round 5 and you bid zero, and you take no tricks, you would score **50 points** (10 points x 5 cards).

However, if you bid zero and end up taking **one or more tricks**, the scoring flips dramatically. You will lose **10 points for each card dealt that round**. So, if you bid zero in round 9 and capture 2 tricks, you would score **-90 points** (10 points x 9 cards = -90 points). This makes zero bids particularly risky, as the penalty for misjudging your ability to avoid tricks can be steep.

### Contextual Strategy/Advice

When considering a zero bid, evaluate your hand carefully. If you have low-value cards and believe that other players will likely win the tricks, a zero bid might be a strategic choice. However, if you have any high-value cards or if you suspect that you might inadvertently win tricks, it may be wiser to bid a low number instead. 

### Example

Let’s say you are in round 6, and you decide to bid zero. If you manage to take no tricks, you score **60 points** (10 points x 6 cards). But if you accidentally win 1 trick, you would lose **60 points** (10 points x 6 cards), resulting in a total score of **-60 points** for that round. 

In summary, bidding zero can be a high-reward strategy if you can accurately predict that you will not win any tricks, but it requires careful consideration of your hand and the dynamics of the game.

1. **Order of Play**: The second card played between the Kraken and the White Whale determines the outcome. This means that if the Kraken is played first, and then the White Whale is played, the White Whale's effect takes precedence.

2. **Effects of Each Card**:
   - **Kraken**: If the Kraken is played, it destroys the entire trick. No one wins the trick, and all cards played are set aside. The next trick is led by the player who would have won the trick if the Kraken had not been played.
   - **White Whale**: If the White Whale is played, it affects the outcome of the trick differently. It nullifies the special cards (like the Skull King or Pirates) and makes the numbered cards compete based solely on their numbers. The highest numbered card wins the trick, regardless of suit. If only special cards are played, the trick is discarded, similar to the Kraken's effect, and the player who played the White Whale leads the next trick.

3. **Resolution Example**: 
   - Let's say Player A plays the Kraken first. This means the trick is immediately destroyed, and no one wins. The next trick will be led by the player who would have won if the Kraken hadn't been played.
   - Now, if Player B plays the White Whale after the Kraken has already been played in the same trick, the White Whale has no effect because the trick has already been destroyed by the Kraken.

### Game Rule Explanation

1. **Kraken (1)**: When the Kraken is played, it destroys the entire trick. No player wins that trick, and all cards played are set aside. The next trick is led by the player who would have won the trick if the Kraken had not been played.

2. **White Whale (1)**: When the White Whale is played, it affects both special and numbered cards in unique ways:
   - Special cards are destroyed and cannot win the trick.
   - Numbered cards lose their suit and are evaluated solely by their number, meaning the highest numbered card wins the trick. In the case of a tie, the first card played is the winner. If only special cards are played, the trick is discarded, similar to the Kraken's effect, and the player who played the White Whale leads the next trick.

### Interaction Between Kraken and White Whale

- If the **Kraken** is played first, it will consume all cards, and no one wins the trick. The next trick is led by the player who would have won if the Kraken hadn’t been played.
  
- If the **White Whale** is played second, it will take precedence over the Kraken's effect. The White Whale will determine the winner based on the remaining cards played. If the White Whale is the second card played, it will evaluate the other cards based on the rules mentioned above.

### Example

Imagine a scenario where:
- Player A plays the Kraken.
- Player B plays the White Whale.

In this case, the Kraken destroys the trick, and no one wins. The next trick is led by the player who would have won if the Kraken had not been played.

Now, if the order were reversed:
- Player A plays the White Whale.
- Player B plays the Kraken.

Here, the White Whale would evaluate the other cards played. If there were any numbered cards, the highest numbered card would win, and the Kraken's effect would not apply since it was played second.

### Contextual Strategy/Advice

When considering playing either the Kraken or the White Whale, think about the order of play and the cards your opponents might have. If you suspect your opponent has the Kraken, leading with the White Whale can be a strategic move to ensure you have a chance to win the trick, as it will override the Kraken's destructive effect if played second. Conversely, if you have the Kraken, leading with it can be a powerful way to nullify your opponents' plans, especially if you believe they might play high-numbered cards or special cards that could win the trick.

### Game Rule Explanation:
1. **Kraken**: If the Kraken leads a trick, it completely destroys the trick. No one wins that trick, and all cards played are set aside. The next trick is then led by the player who would have won the trick if the Kraken had not been played.

2. **White Whale**: When the White Whale leads a trick, it also alters the dynamics of the trick. In this case, there is no suit to follow, meaning that players can play any card they choose. However, the White Whale has a unique effect on the cards played:
   - Special cards (like Pirates or the Skull King) are destroyed and cannot win the trick.
   - Numbered cards lose their suit and are evaluated solely by their number. The highest numbered card wins the trick, regardless of the original suit. If there is a tie in numbers, the first card played wins the trick. If only special cards are played, the trick is discarded, and the player who played the White Whale leads the next trick.

### Contextual Strategy/Advice:
When playing with the Kraken or White Whale, it's crucial to consider the implications of leading with these cards. If you have the Kraken, leading with it can be a strategic move to disrupt your opponents' plans, especially if you suspect they have strong cards. On the other hand, if you lead with the White Whale, be prepared for a chaotic trick where the highest numbered card will prevail. This can be advantageous if you have high-numbered cards or if you can anticipate what your opponents might play.

### Example:
Imagine you lead with the White Whale, and your opponents play a mix of special cards and numbered cards. If you notice that most players are playing special cards, you can expect that the trick will be discarded, allowing you to lead the next trick. Conversely, if you have a high-numbered card in your hand, you might want to play it after the White Whale to secure the trick, as it will likely win against any special cards played.

In summary, leading with either the Kraken or the White Whale creates a unique scenario where the usual rules of following suits do not apply, allowing for strategic plays that can significantly impact the flow of the game.",0.99999999998,0.7931034482758621,0.9341964990356791
