OBJECTS (RED OR BLUE STRIPE)\\nObjects can sometimes interact with other objects\\n(see Combining Objects - page 4). Object 35 is a cabinet. Object 11 is a key. MACHINES (GREEN STRIPE)\\nPlayers must enter the Machine number in the app\\nto access it (see Machines - page 5). Machine 69 is a grid with 6 pins. CODES (YELLOW STRIPE)\\nPlayers must enter a code in the app to continue\\nthe adventure (see Codes - page 6). Card 21 is a door locked by a digital code.

To that end, just add their respective numbers together (within a red 11 35\\nor blue circle) and look for the matching card in the deck. Of course, it is\\nimpossible to combine a letter with a number. GOLDEN RULE: A red number can only be combined with a blue\\n46\\nnumber and vice versa. NO other combination is possible (blue+blue,\\nred+red, blue+grey, etc.). Players decide to combine the key ( 11 ) with the cabinet ( 35 ).

      "Game Description:\n",
      "The Mind Extreme functions like The Mind, with players trying to play cards from their hand in ascending order &mdash; without consulting one another! &mdash; so that they can complete a certain number of levels and win. The higher the level, the more cards you have in hand, giving you more to juggle, but also more information to use during play.<br/><br/>The Mind Extreme offers a more complex challenge as now instead of a deck of cards from 1-100, you have two decks each numbered 1-50. Now you'll have two discard piles in play, with cards from one deck needing to be played in ascending order and cards from the other being played in descending order. What's more, some levels must be played blind &mdash; that is, with the cards discarded face down so that no one sees what you've played. Can all players get in the right groove and discard everything in the proper order?<br/><br/>\n"

      "**Game Rule Explanation**: In The Mind Extreme, a shuriken, also known as a throwing star, can be used by any player to suggest activating it during a level. To do this, a player must raise their hand at any time during the level to propose using the throwing star. If all players agree, the throwing star is activated.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Contextual Strategy/Advice**: Using a shuriken can be a powerful tool to help the team when facing a particularly challenging situation. It allows players to strategically reveal either the lowest white card or the highest red card in their hand, aiding in decision-making and potentially avoiding mistakes.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Example**: Imagine you're in a level where players are struggling to determine whether to play a white 10 or a red 15 next. By suggesting to activate the throwing star, players can reveal their lowest white card and highest red card, giving valuable information to the team and increasing the chances of successfully completing the level. Remember, teamwork and coordination are key in The Mind Extreme!"
